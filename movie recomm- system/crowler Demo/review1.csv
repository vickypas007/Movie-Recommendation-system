"It is a wonderful story emotional and full of existential meanings to see it is like entering a dream so familiar and at the same time unknown. Alita is a very well adapted ancient history that will undoubtedly make a presedente for the future"
"Don� 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)t listen to the airhead critics this movie slaps"
"One of the best movies of the year. The visual effects the story the amazing acting talent! Step aside marvel this is a show stopper!"
"Awesome film saw it & imax and it� 1/2(TM)s upsetting that everyone doesn� 1/2(TM)t agree with me! I truly hope the sequel happens!"
"The visuals were mind blowing and the action kept me on the edge of my seat! Ive never had an animated character able so strongly pull emotions from me. I laughed . I cried. I was beguiled and I found myself wanting more. Please support this film."
"This was a great movie without political or gender biases. Amazing action sequences and characters. Don't listen to the so called critics."
"This movie was spectacular. The pacing was good and the story was solid. Alita is a wonder. I do not understand what the critics are talking about it� 1/2(TM)s almost they just want ro lose credibility. Probably the best acrion film w heart I have watched in a long time."
"Too many professionals out there that don't get the aspect of a movie id say stop criticizing and really watch a movie"
"Excellent movie ever"
"This was a terrific movie! I had no intention of seeing this after the trailers and so-called professional critics reviews. I will be seeing it again this weekend and I want MORE Alita!Ignore the pretentious reviews on the critics tab...once again the audience score is getting it right."
"I came into the theater with zero expectations. Never saw the manga and didnt realize what movie I was walking into. Now absolutely one of my top 5 movies of all time! I'm going down an Alita rabbit hole quickly. James Cameron please for the love of god make more movies! Continue this story!"
"Ignore the critics. The movie adaptation was on par with the original work with the exception of a few parts being moved around to be easier for the unfamiliar with follow. The best anime to movie crossover ever done! Well implemented great graphics awesome storyline. Must see."
"This film is fascinating not only CGI and actionbut also the characters if you watch it clearly. The critics were wrong."
"Great movie but not for everyone there's too much imformation hiding in each scenes could be better if they made it a 3 hour movie."
"the critics missed it.. great movie"
"This Movie is Awesome. Must see the effects are mind blowing revolutionary. I can hardly wait to see more!"
"I was surprised they pulled off the adaptation! There were a few plot problems but this was overall fun and beautifully made."
"Even though that there are parts that are less than spectacular in the narrative the characters are compeling with a defined arc of development."
"Action packed and entertaining."
"A very good movie that is faithful to the source material. Awesome visuals amazing fight scenes and enough heart to keep you interested."
"As a fan of the source material I loved it. It was everything I hoped for seeing the world I grew up loving in the big screen. It gives me hope that we may get more live action anime adaptations with this much effort behind them"
"Alita is a dream come true for a fan of the manga and anime! I loved every second of it!"
"Loved the action and special effects. The story was good and had me wanting more. There were some slow spots but once they were passed you were again drawn into the movie. I saw this in 3D and it enhanced the experience and wasn't a distraction."
"It was lots of fun and the eyes weren't nearly as much of a distraction as I thought they'd be. I wasn't interested from the first trailer but the movie definitely won me over and I hope they make a sequel."
"Here's another case where the "critics" got it all wrong. Just like they gave Disney props vicariously through inane Star Bores Ep VII & VIII they give bad reviews to Alita. I went in with no expectations not a manga or comics follower but was somewhat hopeful due to the audience reviews. I thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish. How refreshing it was. I didn't overly pay attention to the plausibility of the story it's not like I was invested in an inane absence of a New Jedi Order after 30 years or the rebooted destruction of Vulcan (or other film butcheries of franchises)... it flowed I enjoyed it it was a completely fresh take on technology to tell stories not tol before in virtual film with virtual or imposed actors. I enjoyed it from start to finish and would see it again.I also don't know what the F is going on with industry's attack on 3D whether Film Film scarcity of showings or 3D TV's but I'm still able to get new Blu Ray releases in 3D so the F'ing theaters and TV manufacturers should get their collective heads out of their ###es and make 3D much more available and promote it. This movie - like so many others - absolutely shined in 3D and can't imagine seeing it otherwise without some sizeable takeaway.Finally the only reason I don't give this 5 Stars is ... well it's not Blade Runner 2049 Crouching Tiger or Once Upon the Time in the West is it? But it's a damned fine movie for it's genre."
"FANTASTIC FILM! The character goes through an ACTUAL CHARACTER ARC and learns about herself and her place in the world and grows on camera before our eyes. The setting is incredible the villain's compelling and the fight sequences are second to none. This is by far one of the better films I've seen in theaters in some time.  Go see Alita. You will NOT regret it."
"Alita Battle Angel kept me entertained with solid characters real emotions and a whole lot of action. I made an account on this "rotten" website to add my enthusiasm to a film released in 2019 that can be enjoyable and lack any social justice theme not the justice ever needed a moniker. If you had to pick only one film Alita or Captain Mary Sue pick Alita you wont be disappointed and you wont be giving your money to people whom judge you and everyone else based on the colour of their skin or what's in their pants."
"I cant tell you how much I love this movie xD already seen it 3 times they Adapted so much stuff from the manga .Alita her self is absolutely breathtaking the whole world all comes together in an experience like no other.They really deserve alot more credit for this motion picture 10-10 boyie :D"
"Absolutely brilliant."
"Do not listen to the critics I normally take their words as facts but this time they are just wrong. The movie is amazing! It feels fresh and it looks gorgeous. I recommended to everyone"
"Came in to this movie never seeing the anime or even knowing about Alita and I was pleasantly surprised. Look it's a female led movie with no moronic agendas being shoved in it that deserves a watch at the very least."
"Probably one of the best films I have ever seen of 2019. I hope there will be a sequel its a series that deserves its time in the spotlight."
"I really don� 1/2 1/2(TM)t get what movie the critics saw but is not this one ... if a critics tells you is a bad movie you need to see it � 1/2 1/2~cause they don� 1/2 1/2(TM)t know nothing about movies.This is a fun movie ... after all that� 1/2 1/2(TM)s why you go to the movies to have fun .."
"I left caring about this character wanting to know more about her past and future. What more needs to be said? .. go and see it!"
"a very good sci-fi action movie. entertaining. fun. will see it a second time."
"Tremendously aesthetic film with brilliant action scenes and an interesting story. Hoping to see more of it."
"If you have complained about not getting good anime movies and don�(TM)t go see this movie then shame on you!"
"im gonna go watch it for 2nd time..awesome"
"I cant tell you how much I love this movie xD already seen it 3 times they Adapted so much stuff from the manga .Alita her self is absolutely breathtaking the whole world all comes together in an experience like no other.They really deserve alot more credit for this motion picture 10-10 boyie :D"

"beautiful movie waiting for the next one"
"I thought it was going to just be another poorly adapted movie (ahem Ghost in the Shell). I was wrong this was a great movie I loved the graphics the cyborgs and the action sequences. I want to watch it again after writing this."
"So this is the movie critics say is worse then latest the Ghostbusterse and not better then TLJ? Struggles with special effects? You got to be frakin kidding me. Never see the comic or manga version. The Alita character totally surprised me. Was not expecting the movie to be so good."
"It was something fresh something new that many haven�(TM)t seen in theaters in awhile. I watched the movie 3 times one in IMAX DOLBY and standard and I highly recommend DOLBY."
"Not as awesome the 2nd time I saw it but still great!3D works real well!Loved it!"
"Great film strong hero a movie with heart and a good story. Not without its flaws like every film but buy worthy. Some moments were the cringe-worthy "Why are they doing this?" moments but they also treat the reactions to those in the way you would expect. Love the supporting cast though there are moments of blandness to the portrayal. Superb twists and has a darker tone not fully explored. Best part it is an entertaining flick without being preachy or political motivations or social agendas. It's a film that most people have been waiting on. Go support this movie. Don't let it go down in obscurity. I will be watching it again in theaters and will definitely be buying it. This is the kind of movie I'd watch with my kids much like the original Star Wars trilogy."
"This movie is beautiful"
"Great movie can't picture anyone doing a 90s manga any better Robert Rodriguez is an amazing director and has created a great experience visually arresting best experienced in IMAX or similar large format if you are at all interested in anime or manga and like cyberpunk and transhumanism go watch this movie."
"This movie was amazing. Please make a trilogy"
"Despite the arguable flaws I loved this movie and this is coming from an Anime and Manga fan.While a few voices are saying that alita is not god enough or nothing like the Manga/Anime I would make a counter argument.The adaptation to a Western audiance was fantastic. There I said it.When considering the construction of the typical movie narative format and the typical formula of Hollywood (Which I am not a fan of but it is unlikely to change any day soon). Then you can come to grips with the why and how Alita has been forged into how it is.While re-readign the manga you notice many many differences to the live acion film but that is a -good- thing. If many of the Manga story elements were put into the movie than alita Ido and many other characters would have near -zero- appeal or relation with the audiance.As for the story telling it would be episodic and not work in a film -at all-. Each volume of the manga up to the third/fourth tome has been edited merged and streamlined to flow well in a live action movie format. And many of the changes were necessary to create the Hollywood demand for their movie formula for romance etc to be tailored into pretty much every movie made and I feel it was done well and with respect to the original material.It is also wonderful to see that the ending leaves the possibility for a sequel (hopefully) and even a prequel to be available to a budding and possible new franchise. After-all Battle Angel Alita is a long running Manga series and has plenty to offer. It could also make a fantastic Single Player narrative foussed Game.I could go into details but I shall not else I would ruin the movie for anyone who has not seen it.Finally I will say that I am planning to see this great film again and I hope others do too this film deserves a following. I will also be buying it at full price when it comes out on Blu-Ray"
"This is such a great film and has an audience score of 94% let hope the critics don't spoil it for the rest of us wanting a sequel... Films live or die based on reviews and critics are just plain wrong!This movie is adapted from a Japanese manga story and rather than trying to cram a very large story into a single film they have split it over several which is definitely a great decision however this has resulted in critics giving it an overly harsh review as the movie ends on a cliffhanger.I personally loved this film amazing effects detailed and engaging story and great acting this film is well worth a watch.I definitely plan to watch it again in 3D :-)"
"Better than you said it would be."
"I am a fan of scifi and anime and was disapointed with ghost in the shell live action. I came into alita with lower expectations even though i'm a fan of Kishiro Yukito. I was blown away hands down best anime adaptation beating speed racer. I would give it a A to A- or a 4.5 out of 5. Great movie very entertaining and worth the money. Romance was a little accelerated but can understand due to time restraints. Ending is waiting for a sequel which is also expected due to movie covering only the first 4 manga."
"Wonderful movie loved every second. Don't listen to the critics once again they couldn't be more wrong!"
"Exceed my expectations Good story Excellent VFX the background of the story is too huge to be in one movie so there is a little unclear of that part of the movie. Hope they will have sequels."
"Just seen. Absolutely l love every bit of it."
"Have three kids all teens and they all liked it Will see it again."
"This movie is what we have been waiting for! Finally a really good character that actually has struggles and we can root for. Alita represents what is pure and good in the world she is literally willing to give her heart for who she loves. She is just a really well written character and I love this movie I can't wait for the sequel!"next one"
"Film yang indah bisa menjadi contoh film adaptasi anime lainnya.pembetukan dunia cerita dan aksi nya dibuat dengan indah dan teliti.mungkin ada beberapa dialog/scene yang terasa kurangsecara overall wajib ditonton.ditunggu Alita 2"
"Despite what so many of the critics say the movie is amazing. I absolutely loved it. I was smiling with child-like wonder several times throughout the movie."
"A breathtaking and mindthrowing experience James Cameron does it again with his amazing work of bringing a universe for us all to see. Perfect character development and storybuilding as you sit through an entertaining atmosphere of interesting characters and world material.I was thrilled to watch this there's so much to take in even if you don't know the original show or comics. This is a must see movie for anyone looking to see a great story and inspiring experience."
"It was worth the $. The kidos loved it and i found it very entertaining"
"This is a film that is fun exciting and has a strong female lead that is vulnerable and strong in her journey of self discovery. It's a must watch for movie for goers and fans of the source material."
"Saw previews for a year. Thought it was delayed because it was bad. Complete opposite. I loved this movie. Previews did not do it justice. Alita is such a personable likeable character. Best movie of the year."
"Great story top notch performances and incredible visual effects. I was touched by Alita's innocence and the transformative power of her love for her friends. No politics/agenda here just a human story told using killer cyborgs!"
"The script is lacking and the pacing sucks. But Alita supplies on high octane action and crowd pleasing affects."
"As a long time fan of the OVA and manga I loved this interpretation of GunnM/Alita!!!!"
"Loved the movie. They have finally brought a Manga to the screen that works. If you don't go see it there will be no sequel and I want a sequel. Get out there and see the movie."
"This movie was excellent i recommend you to watch this:)"
"Perfekt Movie i loved the story and more the CGI is was amazing. I hope there will be a second Part"
"Great movie. Strong female lead. Worth watching twice if not more. I am really looking forward to the sequel. Alita boma ye"
"The animation by itself makes this movie worth watching in my opinion. But with a story that is action-packed captivating and suberted my every expectation Alita is easily one of the best movies I've seen in years."
"An amazing story that keeps you immersed while many other stories these days are more concerned about lecturing you about your personal beliefs. Alita ignores the loud cries of the SJW minority to focus on what people REALLY want; a damn good story!"
"The whole movie was excellent. It made me feel powerful and in charge I would recommend this movie to everyone."
"Can�(TM)t wait to see it."
"This movie was bitchin"
"I love dirty sci-fi and there are sequences in here that show what a great movie this could have been. What ultimately makes it awkward (aside from the still-not-quite-there visual effects) is that this movie is really more like five different movies pulling in different directions."
"I really liked this movie. It has good characters casting and world building. Biggest drawback is the casting of Hugo. He is so annoying boring and have the depth of a puddle of water. He gives me bad flashbacks from Robin in Batman forever and Anakin from Attack of the clones. It is that level of bad. The story is good. I never read any of the mangas and had no prioer knowledge to Alita but i found that most things were explained and presented in a good way. A few things felt a little thin but i think that was an obvoius choice to provide something for a sequel to explain.The pacing is good and everything flows nicely. The cgi is great and i am glad i watched this in 3d. It was well worth it. Film was a bit more action than i had expected but it was justified.If you haven't seen this yet go do it. It is well worth your money."

"Very good movie. I was skeptical at first that it would be that good knowing how poorly done other Anime and Manga movies usually are. My family and I were looking for a good movie to see last weekend and were not disappointed. It was nice to be entertained by a movie instead of preached to. I am now looking forward to it's sequels."
"The best thing they do to adapt a manga is to enlarge the heroine's eyes. It makes Alita exactly like Gally."
"Ignore the critics as always. This was a great movie!"
"With heavy anime influence and possibly the best visual effects action sequences put to film Alita: Battle Angel is an excellent time from start to finish."
"Definite thumbs up if you're a geek. I'm really glad we saw it in IMAX 3D... insane special effects totally ok plot but those effects!!! It really needed about 10 more minutes of more casual story to help the development in the middle of the film but all in all a fun ride and really impressive effects."
"Low critic score & high audience score these days that means it'l be pretty good."
"Loved the manga loved this movie. Christoph Walz made it even better!"
"I was waiting for this movie for almost 20 years me and dad should be there together he was not with me unfortunately now i realise why he called me Alita"
"Esta película es un regalo para la vista sin duda que en cada plano estimula cada fotorreceptor de tus ojos que hacen que en el fondo se vuelvan tan grandes como los de la protagonista en poder ver su alma humana en su cuerpo robótico y mirarle a los ojos para hacernos la pregunta de �¿Que podemos decirle que haga si no mandamos en su pasado?" porque es ella misma quien debe descubrirlo. Luego tambi� (C)n esta el amor que puede encontrarse incluso entre los engranajes más apretados y que nos impulsa a movernos hacia delante."
"The movie can definitely improve in certain areas but overall a fantastic and unique offering. The critics don't know what they're talking about."
"Very cool looking movie a real spectacle to watch that is worth seeing on the big screen. The action scenes are well choreographed and easy to follow. The big eyes that look so out of place in the trailers are no where near as noticeable throughout. It does a good job of world building providing enough background to make sense but not slowing things down with extreme amounts of explanation. Alita comes across as very real and is an excellent character major credit to Rosa Salazar there. The one flaw is that the film seems to be mixed on what it wants to be drifting between an action packed adventure and a teen romance drama. It would be much better served focusing on the former as that is where it really thrives."
"Saw this with my kids. With the exception of a plot hole or two i was very pleased with this movie and so were my kids. Definately worth seeing at the theaters"
"I really hate movies that don't finish the story. Alita has some good moments but sadly they can't make the lousy plot and the non-existant character development and back story."
"I didnt know anything about Alita exceot that it was based off of a manga. I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. While some of the plot had odd pacing i thought overall it was a solid movie.There wasnt any sort of overt political message imbedded in the movie; they just wanted to tell the story of a cyborg who was afforded a second chance at life.Sure the movie isnt perfect but the emotions of the characters feel genuine. The choices Alita and her companions have to make along with the consequences that follow add nicely to the development of each character.They also dont make Alita out tonbe an invincible being.SPOILER ALERTTheres a scene where Alita gets over confident and lets her emotions get the best of her. She is nearly killed by one of the villains. While completely at the mercy of the villain she accepts that shes about to die; but that doesnt stop her from getting one final defiant blow in.I really enjoyed this movie and would recommend seeing it. The only disappointments to me were not explaining how Alita managed to end up in a scrap pile and who Nova (the villain pulling all the strings) was.It clear these story arcs were left unanswered to delve into further if a sequel is made; which i am hoping for."
"Surprisingly good. I went in not knowing what it's about just that it's based on a manga and anime. Thought the eyes would weird me out but Alita quickly grows on you as a character and you forget about her alien look.The story had some problems though so I can't give it a perfect score - a lot of characters and plots were very unutilized including the nurse (who just stood there) Hugo who was kind of bland etc. The city is postapocalyptic yet teenagers had motorball playgrounds and could buy perfectly good chocolate from street vendors - you'd think those would be luxuries. I would have suggested they expanded the nurse's role as a mother figure the way the doctor was like a father to Alita - otherwise there's no reason for her character to be there because she never added anything to the plot. Cybernetcis and humanity is also a good theme that was barely touched upon. Overall it could have been made into 2 movies that put more focus on these things. But nevertheless the film was very enjoyable and I was not bored for a minute! The visuals were stunning the action was very well made and Alita and the doctor had great interactions."
"This is my new favorite movie 10/10 recommendation. I didn't 1/2 1/2(TM)t not like how it ended but along the terms of the movie there will be a number two! There better!"
"Saw it twice already. This movie is such a blast to see. A MUST SEE."
"Takes so much of the good from the world of Anime and makes an American Action Film out of it. Complete with a strong female character who actually has humanity reliability and growth. (feels refreshing as she is certainly super OP... yet you still can't help but cheer for her) Yeh. They packed the film with a whole lot of things that could perhaps have been better fleshed out in two movies or a series. But heck if my only complaint is "so much to see so little time" then it truly is easy to say this movie is well worth seeing. Do yourself a favor and go watch this film."
"Fantastic movie with visuals to die for. I was really surprised."
"Had a lot of fun watching this movie. Will go to see it again for sure!"
"Had been waiting for this still and was not disappointed wish it went deeper but part two could be even better. Not watching marvels bull besides what would it be about for us. Thanks alita and team for the entertainment and not politics. As if the world needs more crap right now sorry black widow and original gang._._._._"
"Absolutely amazing and very entertaining!"
"The critics are mad that this movie doesn't preach PC SJW agenda. It's an awesome little sci-fi movie with a female lead that is NORMAL."
"Excellent adaptation visually impressive. Effects do not overwhelm the story or depend on effects to sell the movie. and sticks close to Original material for Alita's Looks. The choices made were noticeable if you know the original material but won't make a difference to a casual viewer"
"Hope to see the next part!"
"I loved this sick story im going to reed the manga .... Its a great idea to make old mangas nobody has heard of into films."
"It's a very good and entertaining movie - not sure what's up with the critics."
"Amazing movie flawed but loved it. I had a great time."
"I loved this movie I genuinely enjoyed it alot more than I thought I would. Engaging story and great visuals. This is my favorite movie of the year so far."
"I've watched this movie in a fully packed cinemaman what an experience to watch this movieeveryone was so much having fun and too much cheering while watching alita in her badass moments..I will recommend it"
"Watched this twice in one week and it's a fantastic movie!The story holds so well on it's own; I believed Alita was real for a moment!I could totally relate to the principle of trying to figure out what your place is in this world. This is certainly a master piece of technology. James Cameron has done it again!"
"Badass! Who needs Captain Marvel!?"
"I came out of theatre wanting more. This film is great and everybody should see it."
"Close but different comic but remove my nerd bias and as a movie it was fun and entertaining plan to watch it again"
"Amazing movie! Kids and I loved it!"
"Alita: Battle Angel The visual spectacle exciting action the best manga adaptation how do not like this amazing movie."
"Great movie. Watched it 3 times. Japanese story telling is way different then what most of western audience is used to. Clearly normal folks are glad to see something new but critics isn't. Trust audience."
"This adaptation was so good im gonna start reading the manga"
"Visually stunning. Surprisingly emotional and sentimental. Dialogue could use a little help but a fun story that doesn't try to be more than it is. A shock at how different reviewers and audience members are taking in this work."
"This adaptation was so good im gonna start reading the manga"
"Visually stunning. Surprisingly emotional and sentimental. Dialogue could use a little help but a fun story that doesn't try to be more than it is. A shock at how different reviewers and audience members are taking in this work."
"Absolute best anime adaptation of all time. Probable top 5 if not the best CGI and 3D effect of all time. Visually stunning acceptable story line that is far complex than most action movies including Avatar."
"I had fairly high expectation and Alita - Battle Angel met and exceeded my expectation. Overall storyline was good. The plots within the movie was good. Script was written well. Character development was ok. Production value and special effects were great. I would recommend seeing this movie."
"One if not the best manga adaptation ever. Striking Visuals and Sound strong characters and plot."
"Loved this movie. Why? Cyborg with an innocent teen girl�(TM)s heart. She fell in love boy was selfish but she melted that away. She has the strength and skill of the best on the planet but that pride that pride doesn�(TM)t overcome her love for boy. He doesn�(TM)t take advantage of her and she in turn saves him from himself. No political agenda to get in the way of a beautiful story. I want a sequel. Captain Marvel take some notes."
"Alita is mesmer "eye" zing."
"I am an Anime fan but not of this particular Manga / Anime.The first trailer was Meh to me but the movie grew on me in the later trailers. After seeing some reviews I decided to see the IMAX 3D version of the movie and it was well worth it (IMAX isn't necessary but I would recommend 3D).Is it a perfect movie? No. But it is hands down the best Manga / Anime adaptation to date and still a great popcorn flick for general audiences.Ghost in the Shell was a great effort for what it was but lacked the strong character development and the more adult anime themes that western audiences may not be used to. So I understand why GITS did what it did even if it was a little disappointing.However Alita had good character development made you feel and root for the character didn't go as dark as it could of to keep the PG-13 rating but definitely went harder than I expected for such a rating.The CGI is the best I've ever seen and probably award worthy for VFX.I was taken aback by the eyes when I first saw the trailer but you get lost in the story and character that it doesn't break you out of the movie at all.As an Anime Fan I would give this movie an A.Best Anime adaptation ever gives anime fans plenty of fan service in the way things are done.For the General Audience I'd still give it a B to +B range definitely worth checking out in the theaters.All I can say is that I went in with no real knowledge of the story and now I want to know more about that world watch her grow and am eagerly waiting for the Sequel!"
"Awesome Movie. Well Written and definitely well produced. Some plot points can be a little "campy" but should not detract from the overall experience of the movie."
"The FANS have SPOKEN!!! Alita is a BAD @$$!!! $43 MILLION & counting...SCREW THE CRITICS!!!"
"Phenomenal film. Emotional in the right ways action scenes that rival with Marvel and special effects that absolutely blow all viewers away."
"Now I know that warrior mark across her cheek is dog blood lolThat movie was brilliant best movie I have ever seen"
"This movie is for me the best manga/anime adaptation of all."
"ghost in the shell should be done like this just amazing stuff!!! bravo!!"
"Entertaining cyberpunk movie with breathtaking visuals. They really make you believe that Alita exists thanks for its superb animations and a solid story with balanced seriousness and humor!"
"At the theater I was the audience raved with roaring applause. That's not how moviegoers react to a mediocre movie! I'm glad I wasn't the only one who loved it. Makes me wonder why the critics were so off target with Alita."
"Great adaptation of the Anime Great visual effect. Must see! Critic are sell out SJW don't trust them!"
"Was amazing if you havent seen this movie do yourself a favor and go. Alita is a loveable character who whoops ass throughout in this fantastic cyberpunk story."
"might be my movie of the year. IT'S A MUST SEE."
"I think and I am absolutely sure that James Cameron is the best of all the directors and dreamers of all time.No one else knows better than anyone how to touch the strings of the soul in a good way.Best movie"
"I knew nothing of the story before going to see this. The story was easy to follow very engaging and the visuals were stunning. I left chomping at the bit for more. In a time of regurgitated crap on the big screen it is awesome to see something new."
"Horrible dialog really really on the nose straightforward story and an ending that is just sequel bait. Absolutely loved everything else about it though (other than it should have been R)"
"Having not read the manga or watched the anime I came into Alita not knowing what to expect. After watching this movie I was in awe over the story the scenery the detail in the CGI  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.From the very moment Alita was found to the end of the movie I was enthralled by her character and finding out about her backstory and to see who she would become in by the end of the movie."
"Awesome Flick. Finally something to be excited about"
""I do not stand by in the presence of evil" - Alita."
"Absolutely amazing... an superb recreation of the Battle Angel story. Loved the movie so much I� 1/2 1/2(TM)ve seen it three times already. A must see in IMAX 3D!!!!"
"The movie has some hokie sequences however the visuals are absolutely incredible. Character design is incredible and the world that is created is engaging. Even with this amazing world the action sequences stand above everything else. There is no shaky camera involved. Everything is crisp and feels impactful. I would definitely recommend this movie. We need a sequel."
"It's like Twilight in a cyberpunk setting"
"I really enjoyed this movie and im only drawn to the theater a couple times per year at best. It was action packed the CGI was epic story line was good though I'm ignorant to the Manga series but not for long as i just purchased the entire set. All Hail Alita!!!!!"
"I think I'm in love with a cyborg. Step aside Yugo....LOL"
"my children and I really enjoyed this movie. the story line kept us interested and the hero was someone we all were routing for. excited to see the next installment."
"Finally a anime/manga live action movie that stayed true to its source material. I can't wait to see more. Movies like this just show how the "professional" critics are too far disconnected with the actual people who see these movies."
"Greatest live-action so far!"
"Well the abrupt ending jarred me. now i need to see the next movie. Other than that this movie KICKS ASS"
"Really liked the movie and probably the best movie I have watched in 2019."
"This movie was so much fun great characters great story great picture."
"MCU movies are seriously overrated after watching Alita Battle Angel"
"Awesome movie  i was looking forward to this movie since i saw the first preview last year unlike Captain Garbage. I do not want to see that trash"
"Great anime adaptation. Special effects and characters are top notch. Action secuences are dope and Alita is a hottie. I enjoyed the movie a lot. Bad story and cheesy scenes though."
"Best movie I saw in a very long time. Very close to the source material."
"Grrreeeaaattt movie loved every second!!!"
"Was a very good movie dunno why the bad critics."
"Best anime live action adaptation ever!!!"
"One of the best movies of the year. Best female Hero of the year for sure. Pure joy and adventure with honest moral and no political narratives. A great action movie a good adaptation. Great special effects"
"Totally excellent.... it needs a full trilogy!"
"Brilliant feast for the eyes. Wonderful adaptation of the original source material."
"Amazing film excellent story and mind blowing sfx"
"Una exelente adaptacion la historia que muchos conocen y aman visto lo mejor posible 9/10."
"Movie is awesome DO NOT SKIP THIS ONE! No SJW shit its a pure GOLD!!! Movie is worth every penny. BTW Rotten Tomatoes how come your shit criticism is low and audience's is always high on best movies?"
"In general I like it I don't understand why some critics are so tough on it. I recognize that it isn't the most brilliant narrative but it is enjoyable and left me wanting to watch a sequel. I loved the characters."
"This is an awesome movie it is based on the Anime. Normally they don't make the anime justice but in this case it was an carbon copy of the anime. The movie enhance where the anime lacked like character development. Graphics was awesome the movie develop more on the background of the origin where the anime lacked."
"10 point out of 10I really Love This Movie.Great Action.Fantastic CGI."
"Battle Anger Alita is Awesome! It's what Ghost in The Shell should have been but never war. Plot CGI Actors selection etc. Even the adaptation to the PG-13 and westernization all were done great!"
"The intellectual dishonesty of the so called top critics has really reached a new all-time low with Alita. The movie is definitively not bad nor is it ambitious but flawed as claimed by others. In reality it is easily among the best science fiction movies of the decade blending the motion capturing technique of tomorrow with the storytelling and characterizations from a saner age of movie making. It was directed by Rodriguesz but has the handwriting of Cameron all over the place. I assume that the latter aspect triggered the gatekeepers of respectable opinion so hard that they simply had to go all in and make fools of themselves (again).Alita needs you. Do not stand by in the face of evil."
"A very enjoyable movie."
"Really nice flick much of the identify politcs are left out."
"This was a solid fun beautiful film. It was both a faithful adaptation to the manga and anime and it was an uplifting story with fabulous special effects. While it wasn't prefect (they couldn't put all twenty volumes of manga into two hours SO SORRY!) it was definitely a film with backstory that can be developed further and it had closure for the story we were given despite being open-ended for the additional material they couldn't fit into the movie's running time. The characters were nuanced and i felt like they grew as the film went on. I heartily recommend this!"
"This movie left me craving for more like few others have in a long time. Guess I'll keep buying tickets untill they have enough money to make another movie."
"Alita was a good movie. Alitas face and eyes was a bit strange at first but after a couple of minutes I got used to it. I really liked the characters and the plot felt fresh even though its basically Pinocchio meets manga cyborgs. Now go and see it so we can get a sequel!"
"Make sure you watch this on Netflix or cable. Hmm"
"Excelente! Historia adaptada de manera sencilla sin adornos en la historia pero increíble en cuanto a gráficos."
"The critics are objectivley wrong. Some of them say you have to read the manga and watch the two episode OVA but that isn't true at all. I had barely seen the trailers before watching this in cinema and all the background information is there you don't have to do any research. The CGI is amazing which most critics agree on though there are some that don't. One of the critics that Rotten Tomatoes say is a "Top critic" just said that she was thin but could punch hard. Like what is that why is that a negative review? It isn't a review it's a question which has a simple answer. She is an alien weapon designed to fight. I think RT are gonna have to take that "top critic" away from you because he is just making up a reason to give it a bad review.In conclusion: Never trust the critics just look at the audience score this isn't the first time this happened. The audience liked venom but the critics didn't the audience hated the last jedi but the critics loved it critics hated glass but the audience liked it. These critics don't deserve to be called critics.I'd see this movie more times if i had the money and i don't say that often."
"Really great! I love it"
"Screw the critics the movie was amazing."
"Dig the concept. really enjoyed it"
"Absolutely awesome movie"
"A gorgeous movie one of the best cgi I've ever seen.this movie is made with love and you can feel it!"
"A visual Masterpiece with an amazing maincast. It stays pretty close to the anime adaption from the early 90's and that is a very good thing. There are some alterations to adapt it to a more mainstream cinema audience but it keeps the heart and soul aof its scource."
"Great movie incredible CGI and action scenes very good adaptation. Is very good that is not only battle after battle but it also has a lot of heart and feelings you can get from its characters."
"See this film... on the biggest screen you can find. Disregard the critics score and SJW trolls. It has issues like most movies but the strengths easily overcome its weaknesses. You are missing out if you dont go to the theater and decide for yourself."
"Fantastic film I have enjoy it from the beginning to the end. waiting for the sequel."
"Super great movie. Alot of content sticked with the manga amazing special effects the actors were amazing as well. This is simply a super fun movie definitely worth to watch!!"
"I saw it last night. The fight scenes were amazing to watch. The storytelling was great and original. The acting was top notch. Cinematography was some of the best. Didn� 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)t feel like a copy of something else whatsoever. I have not seen a movie this good in a long time. How I left leaving the theater after watching this is the way I expected to feel after leaving Staw Wars TLJ.Robert Rodriguez definitely know how to make a movie compelling. I am eagerly awaiting the sequel!"
"Eyes kinda creep me out but I want to see it"
"I saw it early and was very happy I did. Where I did not follow the manga first it was wonderful! The talent of James Cameron is where he constantly asks you to suspend reality for moment and just take in the story. Salazar's voice lends to the soul of Alita and the smooth transitions of her origins we're perfectly patched and not too cheesy. And it's larger story wants you to watch more. Thank you Cameron. Superb-ness by Rosa Salazar!"
"My favorite film of 2019 so far and I hope it stays that way at the end of the year. I really love it."
"This is Great Movie I very much enjoyed watching it & I hope we get a sequel. I also Recommend watching it in 3D for a much more enjoyable experience. For anyone out there who's on the fence about the movie pay no heed for what the 'so called' critics say & trust us the audience. Alot of us love this movie & would like to support as much as we can. To anyone who reads this please go watch the movie I guarantee you'll get your moneys worth. Thank you & have a nice day."
"Looks great Good to see a female in a leading role with no political BS Plus they also helped a disabled girl get some prosthetics to improve her life."
"Am waiting to buy the blu-ray."
"Me and my girlfriend loved the movie. I really hope it will do better at the box office world wide in hopes of it getting a sequel."
"best live action anime movie i could ask for too bad that we have to wait to see the next one."
"An alternative to comic book adaptation of course some parts of the movie could feel hollow but the tech action world building and the premise of the story is goosebumps inducing stuff. I want more at least 2 more movies from this title!"
"I saw this is 3D and it� 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s one of the first 3D films I� 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)ve seen where the effects actually work rather than being a gimmick. The story the acting the effects; everything it top notch. I haven� 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)t read any of the original manga so I don� 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)t know how close it is to the source material but for me this film was beautifully made and is absolutely fantastic."
"Filme humano com roteiro bem feito com uma ótima construção de personagens e feitos 3D incrivelmente realista"
"don't say alot it is the most for me"
"The work on the character is amazing the details of Alita expression and how she behave and why is really well done. This movie give clear picture of what kind of charter is Alita. I think the eyes are beautiful and the action are well stage and convincing that Alita is kick ass cyborg. Looking forward to second part .I think some people are disappointed that they don'g get enough of the movie."
"This movie kicks ass. The visuals are amazing James Cameron and Robert Rodriguez made an amazing movie. GTFO with Captain Marvel and Star Wars their female leads are crap. Alita is just like James Cameron� 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s Sarah Conor form the Terminator series. He� 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s back and this film deserves all their money it can get. DON� 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)T PAY ATTENTION NOR LISTEN TO THE FUCKING CRITICS! THE AUDIENCE IS WHERE IT� 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)S AT. The only issue I had was that this film got pushed back from December and the music could� 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)ve been improved just by a bit. Love this movie and I waited a full year since its first trailer. GO see this movie"
"A visual spectacle with a lot of heart fantastic action and great emotional investment with it's characters. Don't let the critic's score fool you this is a crowd pleaser that they can't appreciate."
"I liked the story and CGI"
"I loved this film. I never listen to the "critics" & in the case of this film they've only strengthened that. I rarely see films twice in the theaters but this film was so outstanding I'm most definitely going to."
"Idk how the critics can give this movie a 59 but my only guess is because the series is from Japan and these American critics do not understand the point nor concept of the movie. Did they even know that there is supposed to be a sequel or do they just rate it real fast and not look deep into it. Great scenes amazing picture and good acting. The relationship was a bit odd for Hugo and alita but it is kinda supposed to be like that. Fight scenes were amazing wish there was more gore but they wanted to keep it PG13. Overall great movie and will be seen again."
"Alita was an amazing film it had me so excited and touched through out it. Rosa Salazar as Alita may have been CGI for most of the film and yet her acting and expressions felt the most real I have had in a film for a long time. I didnt feel so jarred by the CGI unlike Ready player one and while the film is brisk at points since there is so much to cover. It works and tells a coherent and great story. I love this film and not felt this way since the last Blade Runner as we just do not get these kinds of films any more and I want more of them."
"great movie alita is very fun person. only bad thing is that you have to many villains at the same time but action scene are so great and make the movie awesome was sitting on the edge of my seat when action scene were happening!"
"I thought it was great as did my daughter. The critics just don't understand! I watched the OVA and it was very similar to it. Some changes were made for the better. The main mistep I saw was the casting of Dr. Dyson did not fit the character."
"I loved this show. going to try to watch it three times. first time in decades a show has made me want to do this. It was amazing."
"Simply awesome. Eye candy with edge of your seat thrills."
"This movie is amazing. I feel sorry for the �professional critics�? as they seem incompetent at best. Bring your politics elsewhere and leave movies alone. If the first thing come into your mind is �too sexy�? then you must have a really desolate life. Good story telling lovable characters stunning visuals. Loved it."
"I would not have thought that I will like Avatar once (I liked only conditionally)..... Alita is titled Avatar and I don't think it does because the movie was very disappointing. I know the comic/anime and it wasn't even close to it even the implementation of the content was a total mistake.... so for someone who likes boring dialogues it's a disaster for me... has never been so disappointed. :( The actors. Christoph Waltz in front were also not so memorable in your roles... Unfortunately.Christoph was much more convincing in Django Unchained and Rosa was much more attractive and credible in Maze-runner. Robert Rodriguez should rather work together with Quentin again and make movies like Sin City etc. because these were good. But with this "big project" the story was unfortunately not convincing from my point of view.But for simple sprinklers it's all enough.I'm looking forward strangely now to Avatar 2 ^^. Keep looking until then ..."
"Great characters and backstory and one kick butt gal! CGI is cutting edge."
"Go see "Alita." See it as big -- and as loud -- as possible. Cameron & Rodriguez both knocked this one out of the park. I know the bar is low for anime/manga to live action translation but this movie *gets it.* It doesn't deserve a "Rotten" rating on website by any stretch of the imagination."
"Awesome fun movie. I'ts a good written story with great visuals. Unlike alot of the other movies we've gotten from similar genre. This movie isn't just all crazy cgi without an interesting story. Alita makes for a great character and i hope we get to see more of her. Story telling done right. Don't let the critics score confuse you. They're paid actors lol."
"Had a great time watching this. Its far from perfect but the characters are fun and the action scenes are awesome especially in 3D! Im going to check out the comic soon."
"Great movie. It does not push any agenda on the audience. Awesome action and great characters that you feel for."
"This film was amazing! I've seen it 3 times already and plan to see it again this weekend. This is coming from someone that had no idea about the source material. So I'm not some fanboy from the 90's. I left the theater wanting more."
"The movie is amazing"
"Please have some knowledge of the manga or anime before seeing the movie. If you're going in with a blank slate then have an open mind. This was probably THE BEST adaptation to live action i have ever seen. Not to mention the CGI and acting were also top notch. I hope there is a push for a sequel. Such a great story to tell / continue."
"DO NOT SLEEP ON THIS MOVIE"
"Really enjoyed the movie. Overally really good with some outstanding moments. Waiting for sequel"
"mixed feeling.. visual effect will cover bad acting story line and some of the lines. But the ending.... ughhhhh ending made me feel like watched 2 hour long preview..."
"I walked in with low expectations and it went even below them. This movie has some untersting ideas and concepts but gets ruined by its terrible dailoug and predictable and un-original story. Feels like q poor mans ghost in the shell. And yes im aware the alita ova came out before ghost in the shell but ghost in the shell manga came out before the alita one and this just feels like that movie but just not as intrrsting. Its the typical person loses memory but turns out to be a person who his very powerful. I know im one of the few that dont like this movie lot of people in my group who i saw it with thought it was the best thing they have ever seen. And its just not very good at all. And instead of just rapping the movie up but leaving a possible opening for a another film it leaves on a kinda cliff hanger. Kinda leaving the big villain around waiting. And even tho the movie was only 2 hours it felt soooooo much longer. So many things could of been cut down or made faster. Such as the whole power ball or what ever it was called elemet. I could never tell when the movie was going to end because its pace and arc set up werent not very well done. I give it probally a 3 3/4 out of 10. If you dont mind a super generic story and are only there for the action you might enjoy it."
"I've eagerly waited for this film to be made for years having been a fan of the manga and wow! The wait was worth it. Seen it twice now and it's now in my top ten movies of all time. Ignore the critics - it's clear they've got this wrong. Great film."
"Oh look at that. The SJW's are mad because this movie doesn't fit their narrative. I mean you idiots are the same morons who said we don't want to see a female lead in a movie like Captain Marvel. You idiots are so full of excuses which is why you fail."
"I do not know the source material but I thought the film was excellent. I take less and less notice of what critics write these days. It is a shame it has such bad reviews as this will influence people to not go and make sequels unlikely. I took my ten year old daughter (massive comic con fan) and she absolutely loved it too."
"Last night i was at chinestar watching Alita and it is one of best movies in last 5 years. I will watch it again for sure just to enjoy in great movie one more time."
"I expected a bit more from Mr. Cameron.However this is a satisfying blockbuster I have in months."
"Best movie I've seen in the past decade. Critics are idiots very entertaining"
"This film shows that Hollywood can do things right. The film wasn�(TM)t easy to follow for me and the story easily understood. The action scenes were fast paced and greatly choreographed. First time since infinity war that i�(TM)ve been on the edge of my seats invested in the characters and their livelihood. Hopefully Hollywood will eventually see what us fans want and I think this film goes far in that direction."
"Looks interesting based on the trailer. I'll probably go see it but if not it will definitely end up on "my list" when it eventually shows up on Netflix."
"Amazing - Never done one of these but cant stand by and watch these critics bash a truly amazing action packed non-stop deep lore movie - movie is 2 hours long didn't feel like it i couldn't stop looking at the screen - the war scene on the moon!!!! whoa...... 99 on your left!!!!!"
"For the "professional" critics that are bashing this movie. For people to understand why the dialogue in the movie is as it is as well as the way the story flows you need to understand when was the source material made and what the source material is. For fans of the series and for manga fans in general the dialogue pace and characters are very on point and it is everything you could ask. This may be the perfect manga adaptation to date."
"Not a fan of Anime but enjoyed movie a lot. At 35 % Top Critics are completely out of touch with the public. At 59% it will not surprise me that if "all critics" are blind and daft."
"Great sci fine flick. Can't wait for part 2."
"Credo che le mancanze narrative siano state lasciate di proposito su modello della narrativa giapponese (per esempio nel film non viene spiegata una cosa fondamentale entro il finale: esattamente come nell'Attacco dei Giganti non è ancora stato spiegato il mistero dei Giganti). La storia è incalzante e divertente con personaggi accattivanti ed effetti speciali stratosferici. Può spiazzare il contrasto tra l'ottima regia di Cameron e il contesto manga."
"I had a lot of worries after watching the trailers and with all of the blatant westernization of overseas intellectual property (Dragonball GitS etc) I wasn't holding my breath. Luckily it seems I gave up on this one too soon and went to see it after a friend recommended it to me. Now it's nowhere near the visually gripping visceral experience that was the original OVA and manga but it did alright at least by yesterday's standards. Today with the gradual enforcement of what is and isn't allowed to be made in Hollyweird Alita (Gally) was surprisingly good and quite enjoyable even despite the numerous changes from the source material that were made. I had said before that Alita's trailers worried me and that was because of the RBF and constantly dour tone surrounding the character whereas Alita in the manga and the OVA was actually quite energetic curious feminine and happy when she wasn't getting serious and kicking some even more serious butt. She's definitely not the same character and there's an awful lot of YA feminism ingrained in this new incarnation of Alita but at the very least the male characters she directs it at are truly despicable; they're caricatures and 2 dimensional but at least where Alita's attitude rises up it's appropriate. I would have preferred less in the way of feminist bullseyes for villains but c'est la vie. Alita's character was still somewhat familiar however so at least this departure from the originally portrayed character in the OVA wasn't so egregious as to be unbearable to watch (it certainly wasn't to the level that the Trailer suggested). There was some random blackwashing of side and background characters�"a hooker and doctor Ido's assistant�"but if that's enough to appease the nutjob crowd then fine whatever since they weren't important characters to the story. It's certainly not as bad as ignoring Captain Mar-Vell's existence in favor of Carol Danvers. In any case the best part about the film and its greatest merit is that it lacks most of the standard Hollyweird suitability staples that the puritanical wrong-think enforcers on the West coast zealously parade around these days as the only things acceptable in media and as I said earlier by today's standards that makes Alita: Battle Angel a really darned good movie. If you need anymore proof other than the bad critic score to show this then I invite you to go and see the film for yourself."
"A Great way to start such Films in 2019 really great"
"Absolutely loved this movie breathtaking visuals stunning world building and one of the best female led sci fi movies I have ever seen. I highly recommend seeing this movie and I cannot wait for a sequel!"
"Exceeded my expectations. This is actually really good."
"Fabulous story and cg effects! The love story between Alita and Hugo really touches me. It is beautiful but tragic I nearly cried for them! I am watching this movie again anyways cannott wait to see Alita2!!!"
"� 1/2� 1/2ли� 1/2� 1/2 1/2� 1/2"
"I like alita and i want to see this movie again."
"10/10 no comment"
"I probably would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't been a big fan of the manga for a long time. It was a mistake basing this part of the story on the anime instead of the manga because the characters introduced for the anime aren't that good. They also didn't really include any of the characters' motivations. They got the wrong actress to mo-cap Alita's part. The fights should have been much more brutal. I was surprised that the 100% CGI fights in a movie can seem slower paced than the same fights when they're just pictures on a page. Could have been one of my all time favourite movies if they got it right but it's not quite there."
"I found her eyes kinda weird but i really like the action in the movie and the story around it its almost perfect."
"Great entertainment but no philosophy or deep story is present."
"Best Anime/Manga Adaption made by Hollywood so far CGI Battles are euphoric Rosa's acting outstandingIt truly deserves a Sequel"
"And for a change a manga adaptation that remained faithful to its source...never seen that before. Yes I know there were things cut out and chronologically rearranged but that was due to time constraints trying to fit the full first main arch into just a single movie. The characters were true to their source personalities realistic and relatable. If there is anything to criticise about the movie it's Iron City being too pretty. It is supposed to be a ruined city living under the trash chute and in the shadow of the floating city. Where did all the sunlight come from? Why was the junk mountain so small? With no physical possibility of the city ever getting rain how did they get enough water to keep the houses clean let alone to grow exotic fruits that need more water (and sunlight) than most plant types (where did they get those oranges from?)? And quaint clean little coffee shops in what is supposed to be a ruined shanty town...what??"
"Absolutely loved this filmI know nothing of source material but trailer got my interest.glad it did. Great blend of character development emotional depth and edge of your seat action... Definitely hope there is a part two."
"An audio-visual acting and storytechnical masterpiece that is simply fun to watch! Please give us more..."
"Best adaptation i've ever seen"
"The best manga adaptation by Hollywood so far."
"Just got back from the theater and I absolutely loved Alita: Battle Angel. The pacing was perfect characters were engaging the world was immersive and believable. I found the action sequences well balanced with plot development and the sense of danger was very real throughout. I will definitely watch this movie again maybe even in the theater. This is not only a must see it is well worth paying extra for a premium experience. I saw it in 3D XD and it was amazing."
"I'm planning to go watch it for the second time on Captain Marvel premiere day"
"Awesome movie. Just go see the movie and get a review for your self."
"Filme lindo com alguns problemas de roteiro mas que tem uma história muito interessante e atrativa"
"awesome movie great action pretty good story and great acting"
"Screw those critics. Just watch it yourself and you'll see why."
"When i went to go see this movie i thought it was pretty interesting and it left me wanting a sequel. The storyline was good easy to follow and more importantly it kept my attention without having to resort to "wow" factors of CGI and mindless action scenes. It's nice to finally see a movie without external political themes tacked onto it. I sincerely hope hollywood start making more movies like this."
"This is the First movie i felt i needed to take the time to set up an account and have my say!Alita: Battle angel was Outstanding!!of special note:Rosa Salazar Wow! She Brang such life and soul to Alita its an over used statement i know but she really did breathe so much life and soul into Alita leaving you deeply invested from her first lines to her last with a performance that brang such endearment one moment and strength and ferocity the next. bravo!Christoph Waltz what an excellent choice and as a 'good guy' this time round and father figure to boot! was both pleasantly surprising and refreshing. the relationship between Alita and Ido just felt spot on! a performance i very much enjoyed!Very very well done all involved!Ignore these CriticsTHIS is the content i will happily pay to see again and again quality beautiful artwork that leaves you deeply satisfied with an experience you find yourself thinking about days later.Thank you"
"Amazing film kept close to the original animation would highly recommend!"
"I created an account just to rate this movie. A friend who had read the manga highly recommended this (which was already a good sign)... Was not disappointed at all; I feel like I need the sequel RIGHT NOW :|If you love Sci-Fi and appreciate great animation and attention to detail do yourself a favour and watch it on the big screen :)"
"The best anime film yet. Although I enjoyed Ghost in the Shell. Alita breaks the curse a live action Anime Adaptation that actually works. I'm definitely returning for a second showing."
"When you do a Hollywood movie and don't treat your audience like 5 year olds and do over exposition about the setting and the character motivations critics will tear you apart also love how profesional paid movie "critics" say this movie rips from thor 3 or Distric 9 when this movie is made ofcopypastes entirely fram by frame from the manga FROM THE 90s it's just a glorious adaptation go see it or don't if you love your overexpositions Nolan style"
"Charming yet clich� (C) however you will be taken by Rosas performance and the world Alita inhabits. It's not reinventing the genr� (C) by any means but if you just enjoy the ride and let the characters sweep you in you'll be glad you saw this."
"Reading critics review I think does critics watch the same movie as i did? I would give 4 star but i give 4 1/2 coz Ive read critisc review and i dont buy this BS. I know it's not 100% accurate adaptation of manga but for me it close enough and enjoyable. Anyway go see for itself. Vry good movie!"
"Despite those Anime eyes on only ONE character...seriously that dives me nuts.... This was an Amazing movie and genuinely had me interested in the story and it wasn't completely predictable at every turn. Before going to watch the movie I had to make sure it had a bad critic score and when I saw the poor critic score I knew it was going to be a good movie. If you're looking for a "new" story that hasn't been done like a million times before I'd recommend watching this movie."
"I've never ever swear on my life do a review on any movie even if I really love it but this one. This one is special. Every minutes of this movie was done right. Not 1 minutes was wasted. The cgi and followup with the manga adaptation was on point. I wish for a 2nd . Please make a sequel and prequel. I'm bringing everyone that I know and letting everyone that I see who ask me what's good in theatre. BATTLE ANGEL :ALITA!"
"The best movie my girlfriend and myself have seen in a long time. It's not perfect but damn it was fun to watch! No identity politics just a good and exciting movie what a novel concept!"
"Love the film. Highly recommended."
"I created an account just to say how wrong can these "critics" be. Excellent movie from all points of view."
"Plot is absolute dogshit and endong makes no fuckong sense whatsoever."
"Best SF movie in years but it could of been better. The story was too stuffed Waltz was underused. But it was a really good movie especially in this times we are living were we are receiving the same recycled stories over and over again."
"One of the best 3d movies ever great use of the 3d effect. This is also one of the best female Superheroes of all time. and definitely worth the ticket."
"This was a terrific movie in every way. Heartwarming and very well executed with charm and fulfilling graphic action. The critics on this site are shills in so many cases. This movie has heart and is a great work of art. I'll be seeing it again in IMAX and taking a friend rather than seeing Captain Marvel that has already blown it with Brie Larson's big SJW spewer."
"Boring dull uninteresting. All the Character were terrible the dialogue was worse."
"Strangely I thought I was going to have with all the pre-release negative hype it got. However WOW! Not only did I enjoy it but my whole family did. When is the sequel go to come out?"
"FMJ all the pro-reviews giving it a low score. I love it. Must go see at least twice. Alita has that fighting inner teen soul deep inside that you miss. Best movies of the year FMJ Captain man-hater marvel."
"Absolutely GREAT movie"
"Finally! A live action anime/manga adaptation done right! Avoid all the noise a go see it for yourself. James Cameron as an eye for quality and this one is no exception."
"Fuck the critics. This movie is a good movie. But you have to be smarter than your average critic these days so if you are as dumb as they are well  still go watch it."
"Amazing adaptation of manga. Great animation and acting. Gorgeous cyber punk vibes. Recommend to anyone."
"This movie is GLORIOUSLY BEAUTIFUL!!!! Alita is the best anime and cyberpunk and Hero ive seen and id like a sequel please!!!!"
"Good action with cool female lead. Would watch the sequel if it ever comes."
"Alita: Battle Angel never fails to deliver aesthetically pleasing visuals and fast-paced action scenes. The technology used for recreating Rosa Salazar's face is the main highlight of this movie and intergrates seamlessly with every scene. This movie is a very strong intoduction to any sequel movie that this movie would get; it builds the world with scenes that almost always has an impact on the main character Alita and the scenes themselves prove to be very entertaining. This movie is a must-watch for its beautiful rendering of Alita and for the world-building it does for any possible sequel movie."
"Its a Perfect adaptation and sets the bar for future anime films much higher. Seen it twice already. Believe me thats a rare feat for a film to get me back in the theater."
"This movies is perfection when it comes to doing a live action comic/manga movie."
"Alita was awesome. Cant wait for the next one. Really fun."
"First time reviewing a movie for any website. GO TO THIS MOVIE!!!! I wish I had been part of an early focus group so that could have given feedback because there are a couple things that could have been done differently/better but it doesn� 1/2(TM)t take away from it being a great entertaining movie. I have been a MoviePass member for over 1 year and also a Sinemia member and have seen a lot of movies and most blockbusters several times but this movie was the most enjoyable and have seen it 3 times and haven� 1/2(TM)t been bored at all and plan to see it again. Many critics discuss some of the dialogue and the love story which admittedly could have been tweaked and I would have liked a little more narration from Christoph Waltz� 1/2(TM)s character about the world and his knowledge but again the movie was so good I took time to join RottenTomatoes and counteract the bad reviews."
"The best movie of the year"
"This movie is fast paced fun throughout! It left me wanting only one thing... More Alita! A+"
"Amazing movie!I came into this movie never seeing the anime but hearing a lot about it. I also didn� 1/2 1/2(TM)t really have any expectation for it but let me tell you I was pleasantly surprised. Like most seeing the trailer threw me off with Alita� 1/2 1/2(TM)s big anime eyes but after 5 minutes in it didn� 1/2 1/2(TM)t bother me one bit. I loved her progression through the story the relationship between her & her father figure the visually were insane and the action was top notch. They finally nailed a good anime adaption and it� 1/2 1/2(TM)s kind of a shame critics are giving it a bad look. I would recommend this to anyone on the fence to go see it in the biggest theater possible. If you have seen it tell your friends and family. I� 1/2 1/2(TM)m going to see it again this weekend to hold me over until it releases on 4K Blu-ray.Also the only reason I gave it a 4.5/5 is because the relationship between Hugo & Alita felt a tad rushed but it wasn� 1/2 1/2(TM)t too crazy as it served its purpose. Again see if you haven� 1/2 1/2(TM)t and spread the word if you have. Don� 1/2 1/2(TM)t let these critics take away our chance at a sequel and more anime adaptions."
"Alita: Battle Angel is a fantastic film of craftsmanship storytelling in classic cinematic narrative form. It is the must see film of 2019 as it faithfully adapts the popular sci-fi manga comic books to the big screen. Great visuals a strong female lead a diverse cast and directed by Robert Rodriguez. Critics who have said that Alita has a sexualized body and that her eyes are too big have obviously never read the books to realize that Alita has no identity politics agenda nor a toxic form of feminist activism which sadly some Hollywood films are adhering to."
"Forget the Critics score and the iffy previews. Go see this movie in the theatre and you won't regret it."
"Watched it on 19th February. Its a solid take on the Manga. People may find it cheesy or a bit rushed. Well it is the live action of the first four volumes of a long running Manga. I wouldn't complain.The CGI is too good. I genuinely cared for the character and I forgot the fact that she is a CG rendition speaks for the quality of the CGI. Hands off to Rosa and the Mocap team.Its a really good film"
"I've seen other anime adaptation movies and this movie is by far the best! These people who call themselves "critics" obviously don't know what they're talking about when they say "it's not good". Coming from someone who's a big fan of animes this anime adaptation movie did not disappoint."
"Movie was entertaining. Saw the trailers months ago was excited to see it and it did not let me down. Not a perfect movie had its flaws but all in all was well done. would love to see a sequel. Give it a try people have their own opinions on movies.. hope you enjoy=)"
"MUCH BETTER THAN CAPTAIN GILLETTE"
"Hollywood take notes this is how you transform an anime into a movie"
"This movie in my opinion is good the reason why everybody is disliking the movie is because hollywood and japaneese storytelling differ alot. The methods used to convey the story in Hollywood could be considered horrible practice in japan and vice verca. This movie is the one of the best manga / anime adaptations to date but with that it carries the japaneese ways of storytelling."
"Exceeded my already high expectations. This is how manga/anime adaptations are supposed to be made (I'm looking at you Ghost in the Shell)."
"Everything about this movie looks exciting. I know the critics are bashing it but I see the audience love it. I suspect to enjoy it as well as the audience."
"RottenTomatoes Stupid..this movie totally awesome..deserve score more than 90%"
"The critics must be old boring and lack oxygen. A great story beautiful character development smart and original. Buckle up and enjoy the ride."
"Any James Cameron film is always going to be worth a watch"
"Incredible and full of heart. Alita is the hero we needed in a time when so many movies are hellbent on serving up cold selfish and uncompassionate characters. I want to see it again and again."
"I went into Alita with a lot of excitement from the trailers but also a healthy dose of concern thanks to the previous live-action adaptations from anime. I came out with all my concern laid to rest and my excitement thoroughly rewarded. Alita has a good story and for the most part tells it very well. The movie is well paced and moves from action to story and back to keep the audience engaged and without fatigue. The whole movie is visually stunning. My only real criticism is that the romance between Alita and Hugo was a little rushed or underdeveloped but it was still enjoyable and charming. Also that Hugo could have been better. He was good in a few moments and alright in most but his performance didn't quite reach the level of the rest of the cast who were all fantastic start to finish. Long story short I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I would happily recommend it to anyone looking for a good time at the theatre. In a season when there's not much out worth going to see I'm actually considering seeing it again while it's still on the big screen."
"In short Alita: Battle Angel is a joy to watch. Tight narrative spectacular visuals and poignant themes this movie has it all. It manages to utilize every moment of runtime without being exhausting to watch."
"At first I thought it wasn't worth seeing. But after word of mouth I went and saw it. At the end of my experience I hope for this to do more than break even and have a sequel to finish it's story."
"Visuals looked great and I love Rodriquez and Cameron so figured I'd give it a shot. Loved it! Great story and visuals. Dialogue could have been tighter but it wasn't bad. Going to give the manga a shot hope there's a sequel!"
"Don't pay attention to the critic reviews this movie is excellent."
"Great movie! A must see!"
"A great movie with a great protagonist. One of the best movies I� 1/2 1/2(TM)ve seen in a while. � 1/2 1/2I will not stand by in the presence of evil.� 1/2 1/2� 1/2�? What a great quote and shows Alita is a true hero. Great characters story effects etc. This is something best scene on IMAX. No agenda or political message either. Just a compelling story with compelling character."
"Never seen the manga. Went for the action was blown away by the entire movie. In my top 5 for sure"
"5 stars just to offset the unfair and rigged critics review. This movie is real entertainment. I never felt so refreshed after watching this move. The strength overweight the weakness in the plot. The lead character despite the fact she is 100% CG you actually care fore her. The supporting cast provided some adequate performance but not easy to crammed them in 2 hour run time. The settings despite being desolate and run down I am blown away by the richness and attention to details. This action scene is very intense and it makes you root for the lead characters. Don't let the PG-13 rating the cutesy lead character or the colorful but run down Iron City fool you Rodriquez did a good job having a broad appeal yet it still edgy and doesn't feel dumb down."
"Best Movie translation from a manga! Critics/haters got this one wrong. Very enjoyable movie with lots of heart. CGI is spectacular to watch in IMAX"
"Great movie saw it a few times. True to the anime and great action."
"This movie really surpassed my expectations. The animation was amazing and the fight choreography was great. The acting was also really well done too. The only gripe I have is with one of the characters Hugo and the acting behind it but other than that I would really recommend this movie"
"I have not seen this film as yet but from all I've seen on youtube and what I've read in different reviews I am very much looking forward to seeing this film."
"I had a blast with this movie!!! I'll be seeing it again for the 3rd time!"
"Critics don't know what their talking about. This was awesome."
"great movie did a great adaptation to the manga"
"Awesome adaptation! I really liked her eyes and strongly believe that they made the movie; and allowed it to be over the top at various times throughout.  On the subject of being over the top it's important to remember that this is all coming from a manga and the over the top stuff is actually toned down for this movie IMO. Despite being toned down it's still rather full of things accurate to it's source material.I've seen some critics say that the story's gore was toned down for ratings purposes but I personally felt like most of the gore was left there but different "mature" aspects were removed instead. While it does remove a little depth for here or there the movie was still great."
"Amazing fun thrill ride. The critics are wrong. See Alita"
"Why do you go to the movies? Is it be entertained? To lose yourself in a world built for your imagination to swim inside? Well...look no further. As far as me telling you about the story just go in blind enjoy the ride."
"Just shows you dumb these critics are if it doesn't fit their agenda! This movie was a great adaptation and I was not disappointed one bit! Highly recommended!!"
"Absolutely stunning visually with a big heart. Salazar's performance as Alita was flawless and i do hope she gets all the praise she clearly deserves. If you like anything entertaining this is a must watch"
"It's about time a manga was adapted to western movies it's beautiful and supremely well made. I cannot believe critics gave it such a low score I mean did they even go and watch the same freaking movie."
"Very interested movie but very a lot of fale"
"As good as any Marvel movie.Though I wish it were longer. Maybe on the directors cut?"
"Saw it and it was awesome! I have recommended it to everybody I know."
"I loved the movie. I will never trust critics again."
"big eyes with a great heart"
"I really enjoyed this adaptation of the manga and really don't understand the lower critics score but obviously I'm not a critic. From a casual viewer experience with little knowledge of the mangas I left the theater wanting more. I feel Rodriguez cast and crew really nailed it out of the park and I fully intend to see it again in theaters but in 3d this time. If you're a fan of cyberpunk sci-fi and action you'll probably really enjoy this movie. Big thumbs up!"
"Excellent movie family enjoyed it all."
"Nice to see good stories that are likeable and exciting!"
"This movie was AWESOME!!!!!. It is totally worth seeing and worth the full price of a ticket especially in Real3D or IMAX. Don't wait till Netflix or Red Box it is the type of movie you want to see at the movies and in 3D. If you see only one movie this is the movie to see."
"Extremely fun movie that doesn't preach to you about the creators' politics."
"Visuals were nothing less than amazing. Solid performance from a well chosen cast."
"Was not dissappointed!!!"
"Stupid critics are totally wrong. Movie is awesome if you like action andrenline. go see it"
"THIS is how you write a Strong Female Protagonist without falling into Mary Sue or SJW territory. See it in IMAX 3D if you can it is the best theater experience I've had since Ready Player One. This movie deserves to make a billion dollars. 10/10."
"Idk wtf critics are smoking these days...."
"Great world superb visuals. The story is compressed which leads to some pacing issues but I have soft spot for ambitious movies even if they fall a bit short."
"I don't talk much because I have a sore throat"
"This movie is the best! Its a must watch!"
"Alita: Battle Angel is a fantastic movie! I recommend watching it."
"Loved it its not perfect but its a visual spectacle based on great subject matter and while it trips up with trying to squeeze in a bit too much. Its completely worth the price of admission. Please go see this and support non Disney owned blockbusters. Especially if you're an anime fan."
"I liked this movie so much I had to come put a positive review for it so good!"
"I need a sequel. This was Great. It� 1/2(TM)s easy to neglect all the work to make this happen. VFX were flawless. This opens doors for more manga adaptations."
"Best manga adaptation of all time! (so far) this is a great film a really awesome experience. This world needs the sequel. As always critics are wrong and their opinions are totally useless....."
"While Alita: Battle Angel struggles with finding it's voice be the issues born from a lackluster script bad pacing or a shoehorned romance the film succeeds in delivering a breakthrough sci-fi action film that you want to see again and again in IMAX 3D if only to boost sales to prompt James Cameron to make a sequel."

"The whole family enjoyed it. Daughter called it the best movie ever and son who is a huge manga fan bought the first 3 books in the series afterwards. We are going to see it again in IMAX 3D!"
"It's fun its SFX is amazing. But the story is a little meh for me. But it's indeed a fun experience. This can be an example of how to adapt an animated picture or manga into a live action for Hollywood filmmakers."
"great. I want to watch again"
"Well worth the 29 year wait a captivating story paired with memorable characters and topped with ground-breaking CGI makes this a must see for avid Anime watchers if I had to pick a fault it would not being able to watch it for 10 hours straight."
"� 1/2 1/2~� 1/2�?"
"These critics are out of their minds. This is easily one of the best movies to come out in recent memory. For me the most important aspect in a movie is the characters. I think a movie can have a great plot and great ideas but if the characters are all uninteresting or unrelatable it makes the movie hard to watch overall. This movie has 2 of the most lovable and relatable characters put to screen in Rosa Salazar's Alita and Christoph Waltz's Dr. Ido. With a few exceptions they are surrounded by other great characters as well. Tying all of these characters together is some of the most ground-breaking CGI ever made along with some of the best choreographed fight scenes even compared to actual Asian martial arts movies. I've seen this movie 3 times already and I would not hesitate to go watch it again. Forget what these pretentious critics have to say give this movie a chance and check it out for yourself."
"I saw Alita for a second time today and liked it just as much or more the second time. No film has motivated me to do that for several years since the days of Avengers Dredd and Pacific Rim. Salazar and Waltz are both spot on in their portrayals. The action and visuals are amazing without demanding to be noticed in the uncanny valley way that can pull one out of the experience. The action set pieces all seem unique and never go overly long. And there are at least two scenes with enough emotion impact to rip your heart out. Best film of any sort in the last few years."
"Just saw this movie and really hope to get a sequal. It was super fun."
"Amazing i hope it open more minds to this gold era of manga and anime movies like ninja scroll akira etc."
"Fun and highly entertaining."
"Great movie beautiful visuals and pretty cool story!"
"The only movie I have seen 2 times in theatres. Will never look at a critic review AGAIN. Go see this movie."
"I'm an anime fan and this movie is animeish. Saying that since it is from the manga then this is me saying the movie is awesome. All my questions at the beginning and coming in to watch were answered at the end of the movie. The effects were impeccable and on point. I was coming in thinking this is gonna be SJW but came out a fan of the movie and Rosa Salazar did a great job as Alita in Alita: Battle Angel. This movie is hard core for a PG movie."
"This movie is a great escape and takes you to another time and place you cannot help but feel for Alita and her struggles to me this was a captivating must see i am starting to feel that the real critics have forgotten what help like and that is a great escape that puts you somewhere else and that's what this movie does put you in another time and place with a charter that you cannot help but like"
"Best movie I have seen this year so far."
"I have mixed feelings about this film. While I did like its action scenes and title character I was pretty disappointed by its cliffhanger ending and the obvious setup for a sequel."
"This is a dream come true I love Alita and already watch it twice! Go see it while you still can in cenima! :)"
"SO MUCH LOVE. Didnt even watch the trailer and it was so good love alitta so much. Great female protagonist such a badass and very lovable"
"The story was a little shaky at first but over all good and a good concept. The action and special effects were great! Over all interesting fun action packed and Alita kicks ass! Looking forward to seeing it again and with the way things ended looking forward to seeing part 2!"
"A wild ride. Decent acting amazing story telling."
"Sin duda una gran adaptaci�n del original y una gran pel�cula lo mejor sin duda el personaje principal."
"Very entertaining and fun to watch"
"Me gusto mucho la pelicula no e visto los comics o animes pero esta genial hasta me dan ganas de ver el anime me gusta el ambiente cyberpunk los personajes como el Doc y Alita las batallas la animacion me parecen de 10 me hizo querer saber mas y sobre la historia quiero ver las siguientes pel�culas"
"I loved this movie. It was good as a manga and it was Awesome as a movie! I've been a fan of Alita since the 90s and I'm so very glad this was finally made. There needs to be a sequel!"
"Great Movie...!!! Very true to the source material; action packed film; really cared for Alita and her journey hats off to Rosa Salazar's portrayal of Alita... True that some of the all star cast was under used but the time they were on screen they were great adding to the story... And of course the world building and the special and visual effects are second to none. Need to see more of Alita's world... Go watch it... Great Movie...!!!"
"Action packed and entertaining. Also unexpectedly dark. Hope the movie does well enough to spawn a sequel."
"Fantastic film. I'm going to see it again."
"One of the best Sci-fi movies I have seen."
"I really wonder about so-called movie critics - especially after watching this movie. It is FANTASTIC! The story is great and the special effects are a wonder to behold. Rosa Salazar does a wonderful job as the lead actor and so does the rest of the cast. I've seen this multiple times in IMAX 3D as well as on regular screens."
"A shock and awe inspiring adaptation. One that should be seen in IMAX 3D."
"A cinematographic experience. Alita atemps to create characters build a universe and tell a compelling story in under two hours and does feel a little bit cramped. But boy is it a great movie.The love interest is kinda dull in the manga Hugo has more depth and it's easier to see the deep meaning of his motivation and how he ends up where he does. Not so clear in the film.I encourage everyone to go watch this film and can't wait for the extendend version myself.KUDOS"
"Really cannot understand the huge difference between users scores and critics score. The movie is visually gorgeous and extremely enjoyable. Clearly there are flaws in the narrative but this is coherent with the manga approach (probably the manga plot is even more flawed but it still remain a manga masterpieece). On the other hand I have rarely seen so much respect and love for the original manga "spirit" regardless the several adaptation and changes in characters and details. A must see from Cameron and Rodriguez"
"This movie is definitely a crow pleaser. The fight choreography is well crafted the cinematography is stellar and the world they build is something to behold. Rosa Salazar really brings Alita to life through her charisma and emotional weight and her cgi performance was never distracting. However the movie is not without it's problem. There is so much to still explore with who Alita is. At times the dialogue is clunky and has too much exposition. The bad guys purpose isn't complete understood or explored. And the love story is very generic. But the good outweighs the bad here so for that reason it deserves to be seen on the big screen."
"It's uh.... pretty to look at. And I really liked Alita in the first half of the movie... then the last half was just downright cringe. I might have liked it a bit more if Hugo and Alita had some actual chemistry. But alas."
"One of the best movies in the past 5 years. Characters felt real."
"This was pretty good. (Spoiler) you don't always need a pure 'happy ending'. There were a few moments where you noticed expedited character development and some clearly missing details but much like Avatar I was enveloped. I left the theater thinking about the movie; always a clear sign this was a worthwhile movie"
"I went to theater expecting to not like this movie. The movie far exceeded my expectations. I'm not sure why the critics did not like this movie. It's almost like a movie has to be garbage for critics to like it."
"The action scenes were fucking incredible. The ending was obviously setting up a potential sequal but it still felt like it was missing something."
"It was very good. I enjoyed the movie and it made sense. I wasn't fond of the ending."
"Critics are snobs. This is a fantastic movie."
"I question the critics who are obviously agenda motivated; this is an amazing movie!"
"Amazing visuals great character development definitely has some cheese here and there and some pacing issues but the action scenes are like candy for your eyes. That being said it's a very solid adaptation to the original OVA and I would definitely recommend it especially fans of the OVA or manga it's based off of."
"I don't trust the Tomatometer anymore they obviously don't appreciate the achievement of creating a believable CG character actually can act. Not to mention the actions alone make it worth watching. As for the story most Hollywood blockbuster have done worse than this one."
"BAA was a very good scifi film as well as an anime adaptation. Follows the source material pretty close but miss some core character development. Something in the film fell flat like the romantic scene. But it made up for all its short coming in action and sticking to the plot"
"Did not have any interest in this movie until I heard so many people saying it was good. I'm very happy I listened. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Blade Runner and the visual effects are seamless. You totally forget Alita is not physically there. She is also a fabulous character full of heart brought to life by incredible mocap and Rosa Salazar's terrific acting. Christoph Waltz gives an excellent performance as well. The main detractors are somewhat cheesy romantic scenes as well as an underutilized Mahershala Ali. Ed Skrein leaves much more of an impression despite not being the main villain. The ending will not be for everyone but it would be a crime if Robert Rodriguez doesn't get to make a sequel."
"Just saw it and i can wholeheartedly say it's good. I read the Manga and saw the OVA's a while ago. And they did a good job translating it to the big screen."
"Loved it great movie and very true to the source material!"
"Absolutely brilliant movie. Loved it"
"Awesome movie! Bree Larson should watch this and learn how to be a hero"
"There are many things that i can say that highlight the greatness that is Alita: Battle Angle. However i feel it can be summed up by one word; perfect. This film is perfect in every way and i salute James Cameron and all involved for dilivering a truely wonderful live action manga adaptation."
"In a word...Excellent! Action sci-fi adventure amazingly adapted for the U.S. audience. Some of the cleanest action shots I've seen in a movie period! This is a must see on the big screen!"
"I went in knowing nothing about Alita and absolutely loved it. I'll definitely be reading the manga now!"
"Great sense of wonder. World is amazing. Different than the manga but enjoyable and Alita is just as endearing."
"went to go see the movie and loved it and the SJW cricis are pissed because she had a curvy body!!! news flash twots GIRLS HAVE CURVES!!! i agree with the audience's score. Why i don't ever care about what self important bull shit sites like this one say about a movie! them and me never see eye to on any movie!!! GO SEE THE MOVIE YOU WILL LOVE IT!!"
"I love the movie! I want more of it!"
"Absolutely loved it a truly faithful adaptation of the manga."
"Cameron's obsession with film craft is on display throughout this gorgeous and exciting movie. There really is nobody else who sets the bar for movie visuals in the way he does and Alita is no exception. The character design is extraordinary and small details betray a deep concern for the viewer's aesthetic experience.Beyond redefining the way movies look Cameron has developed a skill for telling stories that are simultaneously intensely personal and universal even bordering on mythic or religious. Alita is a great example of this being the story of a kung-fu cyborg rediscovering her role in an ancient war while being about young girl becoming a woman and also being a reflection on what it means to be human. The symbolism is poignant and prominent but avoids being saccharine or gaudy. The film gave me shivers a few times as it deftly weaved transedental themes with a masterclass in sci-fi/action. It was not all perfection. Some characters feel a bit like place holders for one. Another thing that bothered me was the movie felt like it ended an hour early. There is a lot more story to tell. Obviously the creators elected to keave the rest for a sequel rather than produce a 3 hour sci-fi epic. All the same I left feeling a bit disappointed I couldnt watch the whole story.In any event it certainly succeeds as a sci-fi kung-fu romp and somehow manages to simultaneously tell a story about womanhood and the human condition. Top shelf entertainment."
"I absolutely enjoyed the film and I can't wait for more. Go see it spend your money and ensure there is more."
"One of the most important movie of this century. Critics are assholes. Blind sad assholes."
"I totally loved it. Although I must say I expected it to last a little bit longer and get to see more world-building and character development; I still loved this film. I am so happy to see Alita come to life by such masters. I and many other manga and sci-fi fans will greatly appreciate 10 more Alita movies."
"Loved the movie. Stayed faithful to the original comic. Good action scenes and the love story wasn't badly presented."
"Alita Battle Angel was a fantastic movie. It was great sci fi which is sadly a dying art being replaced with SJW agendas. This was just a great sci fi movie telling a great story. This is what sci fi is supposed to be please more of this!"
"bfi imax 3d show today. 10 and 11 year olds impressed. quality action. excellent characters. story line good enough. bfi imax made it memorable i suppose as felt like in the same room. best 3d so far by a mile"
"Had to post a review (well a non-review really) to counter the "professional critics". Saw it 3-D and am going back to see it again in 2-D. By no means is this a perfect film. In spots it's drawn out and some of the back story reveals seemed forced. The effects and Alita herself earned this 5 stars. Only regret is the chances for a sequel seem slim. Something I would defiantly like to see!"
"I never saw or read the Manga but i saw nothing negative to critique Alita on. Characters were developed well storyline/plot made sense and also very well told in a natural way. I didnt notice any unnecessary social politcal ideology that we often see in movies today. The visuals were easily the best that ive seen in a movie to date. I highly recomend watching this movie if you are undecided to watch it or are considering passing on it."
"This movie was awesome and it does not have any SJW=NPC crap a really strong independent woman not mary sue."
"I loved this movie so much. The special effects and CGI was absolutely stunning. There is not one second of this film that doesn't look amazing. I thought that the romance plot was moving too fast but I remembered high school and that's basically how it works for people of that age all or nothing OMG I love you so much! You had lunch with Karen OMG my life is over!This is the first live action anime adaptation to not be horrifyingly bad it is in fact very respectful of the source material and I can't recommend it enough."
"Accion durante toda la pelicula no hay tiempo de aburrirse"
"good because no captain marvel. captain marvel bad because disney bad. feeling strong 8 on big eyed girl movie"
"I'm a massive anime and manga fan I've seen a lot of the anime adaptations Hollywood have made and not once did I walk out happy. That all changed after seeing Alita. This the the Anime movie anime fans want. Cudos to James Cameron and Robert Rodriguez. Go see this solid movie. It told a full story left room for a second film and explains everything you need to know without making you feel like a moron while watching it."
"Great movie! I applaud James Cameron. Followed the Anime in a good way and changed it to accomodate the differences from the original. Very intertaining great story good actors and awesome special effects."
"Visually stunning -and action packed other CGI will feel tame after this . ALITA has set a new benchmark. Brilliantly conceived world . And faithfull to the original graphic characters .As its manga based the bad guys are violent.. but the surprising element is how much soul and how well the main characters motion capture played by Rosa Salazar comes across. Its a must see cinema film .dont wait for streaming etc .."
"It you read the graphic novels the movie stays pretty true to the story (minus some of the gore). The visuals are amazing Alita is the best 3-D movie I have seen period. Really really hoping we see a much needed sequel."
"Alita: Battle Angel is a movie at its best when Alita is fighting or engaged in an action sequence. There's certainly alot to like from the film. The world that is created is interesting as are the different unique robots/cyborgs.  However there's a lame love story that drags the movie down a bit. But when she's tearing things up it really shines. The CGI especially Alita herself is quite impressive. They set it up for an obvious sequel. Definitely a fun time at the movies. Good action and science fiction. I definitely would like to see a sequel."
"While the critics surely didn't enjoy this movie I certainly did. This is the best live action comic/manga we've had to date - the character feel so real it's makes you wonder at certain points if she isn't alive. The actress breathed life into Alita in a way no other actor has done before and made you care about her ending. With a definitive James Cameron feel to the movie made right here in Austin it also has the grit that only Robert Rodriguez can bring - and did bring. Worth a watch on the big screen for sure"
"Astonishing special effects great story and the action kept me on the edge of my seat. I enjoyed the movie and had to go and watch it a second time and enjoyed it more the second time round. :)"
"The movie is simply great. I can't really find words to explain how I am feeling about it...It looks amazing the CGI is something different they really pushed further the line of what you should expect from a movie.To me the only real flaw is that Hugo's backstory was not fleshed out. Other than that the story is really nice in my eyes: they did not explain everything(we did not really seen what's in Sanem for example) but they did it on purpose so that the viewers ask themselves a lot of questions-they can imagine a lot of things by themselves which helps in creating a really personnal relationship with the movie. Moreover I believe that some points are left out in order to make a sequel and to keep the viewer interested in that sequel. It worked for me I am hooked and I can't wait to see a sequel coming out.Alita is absolutely reliable and "human" by which I mean she is not a Mary Sue(which seems to be the modern definition of a strong female character) she is an actual strong female character with morals strenght and emotions the difference with a Mary Sue being that she has some actual "flaws" being for example the fact that she trusts others too easily and that she fails multiple times and actually needs help. She is not perfect and that's what makes her perfect if I may say.As a final point: this movie doesn't shove SJW morals and politics down your thoat( hello there TLJ). Finally a movie that is simply entertaining and of which you go out full of thoughts and questions - which are offered to the viewer in a very subtle and gentle way. They do not focus on the disparity between poor and rich or a superstrong woman which succeeds in everything. Instead they give the viewer the opportunity to either simply enjoy the movie or reflect upon it and think about what the story actually means to say. Either way it is absolutely entertaining and again the visuals really pushed the existing limits.All in all you will definetely enjoy that movie being for the visuals the ideas put in it or simply because they finally leave the viewer alone and forget about SJW crap."
"I am addicted to this movie. it is so fantastic the last part got me and I want a sequel / I hope this movie will do good. i hope it will stay long in IMAX so I can watch it again...I am confuse how this movie is being made..they said the girl is CGI..but looks real. just wow."
"The best anime and manga adaptation to screen to date It is as true to the original source as could possibly be for a screen adaptation.As for the critics well they can go jump! This movie is incredible. Critics bashing on James Cameron for the story line and not knowing how to wright a script  It� 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s not his story and not his script!It is an adaptation from Manga to screen that he got the rights for becouse he loved it. Changing it drastically to suit people now and not 30 years agowhen creator Yukio Kushiro wrote the story it just would not please the die hard manga fans and the original material.Without the love story it� 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s not Alita ! Without the epic fighting it� 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s not Alita  without the multi layered world and exploring and discovery of her self it wouldn� 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)t be Alita ! Sure if you� 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)re not a manga or anime fan and watch this movie you will find some old cheese lines or diolgue!But the over all pace and tone of the movie  the action and exploration of this world is so well done  you only want to sit back and keep asking for more! Alita was surprisingly awesome to watch in 3D as I thought it wouldn� 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)t matter much. Can� 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)t wait for the rest to be made !!!! Go see this movie for tour self  stop reading and listening to dickhead critics!!! Find out how awesome Alita is for your self !!!!"
"bestt movie ilove it"
"Absolutely exceeded expectations Alita does what many adaptations fail to do stay true to it� 1/2(TM)s origins and tell a story that audiences will love and think about long after the credits roll."
"Best Manga adaptation to date everyone I know have praised it I can see it having a long run"
"The third act is a little messy but over all I loved the movie you can get emotionally invested in the main character. I would love to see more from this universe."
"Loved this movie! It's so fun to watch the most pioneering CGI! Also the Alita character is really well done both in terms of action and inner journey. Not sure why the critics is giving such low score. But I swear go watch it you will enjoy it! Make sure to watch IMAX 3D!"
"good manga and the way they have done good things for real people"
"This film is a fantastic showing of what cg and visual effects are possible in 2019! Don�(TM)t let critics deter you from seeing this film. The pace was great overall. Very action packed Alita will surely steal your heart by the end of it!"
"gorgeous movie they really went all out in the effects department. story was a fun romp though the dialogue could have been tweaked a little bit. all in all i enjoyed it though."
"Watching this movie again genuinely it's a great film! Story-wise is my only complaint here but it is a really great flick!"
"I really REALLY like this movie! The effects are great the charakters are great (maybe except Jugo) its funny it has really good action. I cant see why critics dont like this movie. Thats just another proof for me to not thrust the critics. Okay for people who dont know the Manga its based on the movie can be a bit weird but even if you dont know the Manga its still a great movie. Just go and see the it for yourself!"
"I really enjoyed it. Hope it will get a sequel."
"Great movie. I never trust the critics."
"Wow entertains with hardly any preaching! No wonder it's getting a hard time from the shills. It's predominantly an effects vehicle but the thing about a cyborg is that it still has a heart...and thus you can still care. For once the frantic fight scenes are choreographed so well (ok there's some slo-mo) that you can always make out what's happening and so there was no need for any hand-held-wobbly-cam stupiddery to force up the panic level artificially. Nice one. I shall go and see it again next week."
"When I went to see the movie I expected it to be pretty bad. However I was more than positively suprised. Alita is a very likeable character and was well translated from the source material. The romance seems corny at times but is still very touching giving the Alita and Hugo a more human feel than most characters in romantic movies. Action scenes are just brilliant with well choreographed fights and amazing effects. Even though most of them are CG there is still weight behind most encounters. The CG is executed well and meshes well with the rest of the cast and environments. Only one scene comes to mind where the background was visibly flat but other than that it was a very immersive experience. It's a movie with heart and action that I can wholeheartedly recommend."
"Very interesting both me and my wife had a blast while it does have some issue but the movie is captivating unlike the trailers"
"Critics are smoking crack. This was a very well written movie that really gets you in the feels. Makes you wonder how far you would be willing to go in the world of cybernetics. Alita is written very well shes a strong character with weaknesses that allows the audience to relate to. I loved this movie. Well done James Cameron!"
"This was an amazing movie that pulled off the manga on the big screen and stayed true to the character's. It is a must see in IMAX 3D James Cameron knows how to make beautiful and stunning pictures."
"Loved it great to see this finally on the big screen well done James Cameron for your vision. Just brilliant to watch an exciting movie with NO SJW BS in it. CGI & motion capture was awesome. I've seen it twice so far and paln to go again. Looking forward to the sequel."
"Great Movie Alita is a great chracter Rosa Salazar kills it as Alita she did an awsome job only con/nit pick is that the movie felt a little bloated but other than that great movie"
"Lots of hate have came this film way. I've never read the manga. but watched the anime many moons ago Adored it. So I want this film to do well. will it fingers crossed. I enjoyed the film yes some of the script was a little cheesey which as been stated by many but don't let that stop you going to see it in big screen. It was not only pure eye candy great action. CGI it was pretty much what I could have hoped with for live action anime and I'm a huge anime fan. Do you need to be a fan of anime though to enjoy this film no. Will it help yes."
"Fantastic story world creating and emotions! Love it."
"An absolutely amazing and white-washing free anime movie that stuck with the source material and made a great movie in general"
"Honestly such a good movie has all the qualities that could make it a future classic that you show your kids one day. Definitely looking forward to the sequel. The fact this this film is getting so many negative reviews astonished me..."
"Cannot believe Alita is rated 59% here. That's why nobody trust your "critics" anymore"
"I don't understand the hate. It was a very entertaining movie. I left the theater hoping for a sequel."
"Although not the greatest movie in some aspects the whole result is somewhat magic. The movie is shining with love of its creators."
"this jumbles up the timeline of the Manga/Anime a bit but mostly stays true to the plot. Certainly worth watching for fans of the story."
"I had zero reference as I've never read the manga. In saying that I really enjoyed the movie and it was fantastic to seeing this world for the first time."
"Really enjoyed it great fun popcorn movie. Def. worth seeing on the big screen go see it!"
"Epic movie! no agenda being pushed just entertainment"
"This movie does a massive job at giving us a proper hero. One minor flaw is the romantic story but given that it IS a teenage romance it's gonna be cheesy. Other than that this is one of the MOST badass movies I've ever seen. Thank you for making it. Fans of the Manga will love it."
"Really enjoyed the movie. It was entertaining and engaging. I haven't get bored even for a frame. Can't wait for a sequel."
"Best movie ever! Better then Captain Marvel... skip Captain Marvel but check Battle Angel Alita. #greatmovie"
"First wonderful world building mostly done by the source material but I really think that the photorealistic CGI enhanced the world building and you felt that the directors really knew the source material. I talked for hours with my friends how this was one of the best female characters Ive seen on the big screen in a long time shes strong and proud while at the same time not being a Mary Sue. She showed her weaknesses let others help her and learnt from it which is exactly how any character should be written female or male. Her story was amazing and you felt nearly emotional as you followed Alita on this inspiring adventure to figure out who she really is. She went from being shy to really feeling confident in herself (wish it didnt go so fast however). I really feel like Alita could be a great inspiration to many young women in their early teens. As you might be able to tell I really liked it it had a lot positive things about it but as all movies it did also have cons.Biggest con must be the romantic story which I had a hard time getting behind didnt bother me much at all looking at the whole movie however as the CGI world building and Alitas story made up for it all still something they couldve done better tho.I also wish they would as previously stated had a bit longer learning curve she went from being shy not knowing what an orange is and not knowing how to play motor ball to basically being an extrovert and kicking bad guys in the face.They couldve made some short time laps video spanning over more days where she gets to learn these things just went a bit too fast for my liking.Thats about it however if you havent seen it then do its amazing in so many ways hell if youre interested in tech like I am you should see it just to admire the details and amazing work done by the CGI department."

"I loved this movie. Great feel good movie with excelent 3D graphics!"
"Alita is loveable the action is great the story is ok."
"While there were a couple of times the dialog got soft it was a great movie. Well worth seeing it. I will watch it again."
"Incredible! Probably the best Anime adaptation of all time. I fell in love with Alita."
"Excellent movie. Alita is a killer coming of age movie that shows out heroin fail many times but get back up even with only one arm and punch failure in the face. It� 1/2(TM)s a legit meaningful story with some deeply moving moments and even dark themes to grapple over. It� 1/2(TM)s violent so kids under 8 probably not advisable."
"Battle Angel AlitaViews so far: 2Format: IMAX 3D and StandardCasting: 10/10Story: 7/10 Combat scenes: 9/10Visuals: 12/10 (this thing is beautiful)Will I be buying: day 1 absolutely in whatever special edition I can find. I need to see all the "behind the scenes"James Cameron has provided us with a remarkable version of Yukito Kishiro's vision of a dystopian future. Visually this movie is stunning and very detailed. That combat scenes were well choreographed. The story was written well enough and the acting is solid. It's a self contained story that could also be used to springboard a franchise. Just as the Anime had its differences from the Manga this has its differences from both of them. If you can't accept differences created by Hollywood then stay at home. If you can go with an open mind then see this movie."
"I been wanting to see this movie since I first saw the anime OAV movie about 20 years ago. So I was super amped to go to the early screening. But of course I couldn't make it. But I was one of the first to see it when it officially released in theaters. It wasn't a perfect movie but I enjoyed it very much.The film is based on the Japanese manga series. Without giving a bunch away at the beginning of the film parts of a robot is found in a junkyard by a doctor who specializes in robots and cybernetics. He fixes her up and gives her a new body. She has no memory of who she is or where she came from but as time goes on we find out that she knows how to fight. She uses her skills to become a bounty hunter. She learns more and more about herself as time progresses until she finds out exactly who she is and what her goal is.The love interest in the movie Hugo makes money by stealing cybernetic parts from innocent civilians and the local motorball athletes. He is a full human who falls in love with this completely cybernetic young girl. It was a love story that i couldn't really believe or root for. They tell each other how much they love each other close to the end of the movie and I have no idea where that came from. All they did was play some street motorball together and bum around the city a bit. I didn't get it.The special effects are awesome! The fight scenes are inventive and exciting! The CG characters are very lifelike. Everything is beautifully shot and animated.However there is alot going on in this movie. If this movies was simply about finding out her powers and abilities while being a bounty hunter the movie would be great! If the movie was simply about using her skills to become a motorball champion and earning her way to Sky City the movie would be great! If the film was about her quest to take out Vector great movie. Instead this movie is about all of that put together so i had a hard time finding out what her actual goal is. We get flashbacks of what she was doing in her past life which is above and beyond cooler than what is currently going on but we don't get that movie. A movie about who she was before being found by Dr. Ido would've been a better movie than what we got. Maybe it's not too late for them to make a prequel. TL;DR: The movie looks beautiful. The action scenes are insane and awesome. They stretch the limits of violence in a PG-13 movie. The love story was not needed. I wish the film chose what kind of movie it wanted to be and not give me a ton of plotlines crammed into 2 hours."
"Worth watching a second and even a third time. Great story great production great acting: everything for everyone! A+++"
"Overall Alita is a good adaptation from the comics. Some scenes actually gives me chills. I waited 18 years for this movie to be made. However I do think James Cameron missed the mark on making Alita into a masterpiece. Several Misses in the Movie *** Spoiler Alert***1). Hugo background story explaining why he was so driven to go to Salem. 2). The shock when Hugo turned into a cyborg. (a 10 secs mirror scene would have been sufficient)3). Hugo escape not because he was being hunted. It was the shock that he lost his human body and the realization that one million chips means nothing to Salem. He climbed up the transport tube to Salem and let it rain. That� 1/2(TM)s how Alita found him.4). Hugo� 1/2(TM)s dead scene seems hollow. The feelings did not linger long enough to make it into a center piece of the movie.5). Dumming down the comics into a simple Good vs Evil conflict. 6). Giving too much away about Alita� 1/2(TM)s memory and Nova� 1/2(TM)s nature."
"The film is just pure fun there are few good American adaptations of Japanese works but this is one of those few. The ending was not a problem to me because it completed the arc and the journey she was on the ending that many others are expecting is much more of a side story. So if you are looking for a movie to escape with and just have a good time then Alita is for you."
"Her eyes are too big"
"Very good movie. Plot is a little thin but that us what leaves you wanting more. Based on a manga series that later got an ova. Movies is very close to the source material which is a good thing. Cgi abounds but after awhile you get used to it. Alitas big eyes make her stand out and is blended perfectly with te actress. Overall good movie."
"I was shocked by how much I liked this film! Im not sure what movie the critics watched or if they even watched it at all. I was entertained all the way through. Great character and a visually stunning. Fantastic time at the movies."
"Alita: Battle Angel is a very refreshing break from the constant flow of superhero movies which seem to be the only real source of blockbuster action these days.Speaking of superhero movies however Alita is held back by one common trope in such movies: stupid one-liners. While most of the movie's heroes stay away from the trope our villains continually sputter out laughably hilarious threats in an over-dramatic voice. An over-dramatic voice is also sadly common in superhero flicks.Most of the movie's performances are well-executed especially that of our star: Rosa Salazar. Rosa does an excellent job portraying Alita in her light-hearted and innocent moments and in her darkest ones.Speaking of innocence it's what makes Alita truly stand-out against a plethora of other powerful female protagonists. While her story ends up taking a darker turn watching Alita learn about the world around her was extremely delightful. And even as she was forced to chop up baddies you felt it was well-earned because of the way Salazar built up her character's arc. Christoph Waltz also did a great job making us believe the father-daughter love he had for Alita.Lastly I feel I need to mention the filmmakers who stuck strongly with the source material. While many movies do otherwise this movie realized what fans loved about the Manga and did their best to translate it to the screen. For this I respect them strongly.Overall Alita is a very very enjoyable action flick and I highly suggest seeing it - in IMAX if you have the money - if you're craving some solid entertainment."
"Beautiful film thank you for this experience!"
"Way better than expected!! Not quite up to par as Avatar but it's pretty close to it. As an Avatar fan I was entertained from start to finish. The special effects were excellent no cheesy cartoonish CGI here. And was surprised that there's a "love story" to the plot along with the heroism with entertaining action sequences. Looks like it's set-up for a sequel can't wait!! ;-)"
"I NEED A SEQUEL!!! What a great movie!"
"These critics are trash they have no idea whats a good movie"
"Alita was amazing! Rosa Salazar did an amazing job bringing her to life and not to speak of the storyline! Seen it twice in IMAX and maybe yet one more time..."
"Loved it. Saw it with my kids now they can't stop talking about it. My son loved the action. My daughter loves Alita. I'm not sure what movie the critics were watching but it wasn't the same one we watched. Alita is a relatable heroine that you'll want to cheer for. Her relationship with the doctor and Hugo was very touching. When she called the doctor 'father' my eyes got watery. My only complain is that they didn't give the guys enough to do."
"I think this was a very good movie. And don't know if it's becuse I like almost every movie i watch or if I only pick good movies. :D"
"I wish there was more story but this movie is extremely entertaining nonetheless. Hoping for a more story driven sequel."
"Excellent movie completely underrated by critics. Worth the money to see it in theaters!"
"I SAW THIS 2 TIMES! I REALLY LIKED THIS movie "Alita: Battle Angel"(2019). It was MUCH BETTER than I thought it would be. I saw this with around 300 people who also seemed to like it. I saw this 02/(Saturday 16 and Sunday 17)/2019 both times starting around 7pm(CT)."
"I really enjoyed it although I felt like it ended too abruptly."
"I believe it had qualities but the dialogue was very cheesy and had some awful one-liners. Although I do love the story of her finding her way and rising up against everyone even if they don't believe in her. It only takes only the right person to help. To me it could have done without the romantic subplot. She didn't necessarily need to fall in love with him. It made it seem like love is the only way a robot like her could have feelings. Overall the whole thing felt like a cliche. But I go give props to Rosa Salazar props for her amazing acting and the emotional portrayal of Alita. How bright eyed and naive she was and then in an instant she turned into warrior to help the people."
"Saw this movie. It was good. You should go to the theater and see it too."
"Alita: Battle Angel has a quick draw in with it's loving characters to it's beautiful design. Now watching the film both in 2D and 3D IMAX I can understand why the 3D IMAX was advertised as a must see the art design the realism is absolutely gorgeous. Going to the Alita character her capture into the audience hearts seems to happen at an instant her adorable smile and gentleness gives her a magical telling of her story arc. From seeing Alita wake up we begin to admire her not until we see her fight in the alley do we see why she is so unique and most powerfully when she is sat on her bed looking out towards the moon with skyscrapers in view holding a toy do we get sympathy for her as she doesn't even understand herself. After watching the film twice there was no part of the film in which I wish I could skip most films romance give awkwardness and often these are the scenes you skip however with Alita there is no awkwardness with Alita and Hugo as you fell no sexual tension as it is simply not possible. For a conclusion I will say this Alita: Battle Angel is perfection with a compelling story and a lovable set of characters. And with hopes of a sequal can make this origin a film which we can love."
"Ignore the 'critics' that are SJWs trying to promote waste of Captain Marvel"
"Good movie. Very cool."
"So awesome. Better than i expected. Alita was so real!!!"
"Сли�к� 3/4� 1/4 п�ед�?каз�е� 1/4�"
"Exciting and well developed characters in a good story. I'm usually skeptical of 3D movies but would recommend this one to everybody."
"Alita: Battle Angel is an average film. Worth the money fun to see in the theaters but nothing special to divide from the other action movies. The CGI and animation was beautiful and captivating the plot itself was a little bland but the characters for the most part were likable. Except for the character Hugo he was so bland and I think that the story would of been so much better if it wasn't a love story. It kind of ruined it because their love was so forced if it was a friendship then I think it would make the movie stand out and we would feel more for Alita and Hugo. But overall I would maybe watch again and I'd recommend you see it just because the animation goes hard."
"I wasn't expecting much from this film but I came out pleasantly surprised. The effects are great and the story is compelling."
"Best animated to live action movie so far hands down!! Next generation special FX that even top AVATAR. And wonderful story line even improving on the original source material in some parts."
"I thought it was a very entertaining movie. I want to see more ALITA sequels ASAP !!!"
"This movie was fantastic. Loved Alita loved the action the flashbacks got me real excited to know more about the universe. I cried 3 times during the movie. What an enjoyable movie!"
"Interesting and highly detailed world but that is it.Plot and dialogs are very childish and cringe just horrible. Movie has a certain charm and i may be not against sequel but i totally understand if it would not be made. Looks like the movie would not be profitable.Oh and the biggest problem with this movie is the ending which is not satisfying. Cant say it is a cliffhanger more like the end of part 1 of a book and you have no idea if there will be part 2 with the real ending."
"Action that you can follow and understand a cgi that don´t distract you and a fun movie overall I like this movie :) a lot"
"The opening scene is straight out of the manga. True to the spirit of the story; Alita pulls out your heart in a condensed version of the first three books.Die hard fans won't be approve of the cinematic adaptation.Understandably no other can surpass one's own imaginationThat being said Alita Battle Angel is a worthwhile see."
"Ignore the critics. This is a great film that will keep you engaged from the start. James Cameron and company have done it again. Can't wait for the sequel!"
"Loved it one of the best flicks in a while. Can't wait for the sequel."
"I really enjoyed the movie! Great female role model great fighting scenes and just fun movie to watch. I would recommend seeing this if you like sci-fi fantasy and action movies."
"loved it just awesome!!!"
"Que cosa tan podrida que guion tan pendejo que lastima ver a Waltz Connelly y Ali haciendo el ridiculo de esta forma. Pesima de principio a fin con unos personajes de pacotilla es que ni las muy buenas escenas de accion animadas la salvan. Muy puerca."
"This movie was not even on my radar until I saw all the positive reviews by critics I trust. I saw without even seeing a trailer and I was invested in the movie within the first 10 minuets. The story is truly gripping and the visual effects are completely amazing ."
"Loved it! This movie was exactly what we were hoping it would be (after watching the trailer). It did not disappoint."
"Fantastic Brilliant another genuine female action heroine the style of and just like Wonder Woman Ripley from the Alien franchise and Sarah Conner from the Terminator (First two movies) franchise brilliant GO SEE!!!!!"
"This is pretty great. It delivers what i expect it sets out to do. It's just a really fun movie. Amazing visuals."
"the visuals are amazing the main character is more relatable and human that alot of heroines we have gotten in a long time and good job James cameron on not giving up on your dreams of this movie"
"Critics are the next cashiers."
"Romance could have been better but the rest of the movie was noting more then "High octane fun!""
"It� 1/2 1/2(TM)s a must see had a great time. Seen it 3� 1/2 1/2(TM)times now and planning to see it for the fourth time at the Imax 3D. Hoping there� 1/2 1/2(TM)s a sequel"
"Only few problems in dialog and chemistry issues with it. But rest is solid good Time and Entertainment."
"Nice movie with interesting ideas ..And most importantly deprived of all this propaganda nonsense...."
"An amazing movie good story for only being told part of it so far and top Tier acting from new comer Rosa and the rest of an all star cast. The only thing this suffers from is critics shitting on it because it's based on a manga and that is all they think they need to know. This is what female empowerment should look like instead of hate mongering."
"Great special effects and excellent fight scenes. Worth the time and money. If you like sci-fi go watch it you won't be disappointed."
"It is just perfect and amazing!"
"'Alita: Battle Angel' (or as I like to call it 'Alita:you'll be surprised what you can get into a 12A film when the bad guys are cyborgs and have blue blood') Is probably one of if not the best adaptation of a manga/anime to a western audience we've gotten in recent years.To cut a long review short: The action scenes are a work of art and probably the most visceral and brutal big cgi fights I've seen from a blockbuster film. Many moments feel as if they are taken straight from the panels of a manga (hardly surprising given its source material (which I plan on buying as soon as possible now I've watched this film)) yet still feel fluid and expertly rendered. The relationships between Alita and the supporting cast are great and actually quite grounding in a high-concept sci-fi cyberpunk world especially Alita's struggle with discovering (or perhaps re-discovering) of her identity.Not to mention the world is beautifully created by the special-effects prop costume and set departments all of which find their connecting tissue in the titular character. If people discussing the effects have noted how Alita's design smacks of the uncanny valley and fails to look totally human don't let that put you off as that is the entire point of everything in her design from her giant anime-eyes to her strange doll-like proportions and articulations. These aspects are deliberately done to emphasise her non-human origins. This allows for the veiwer (or at least for me) to fully accept the world's far more outlandish cyborg designs in the film of Grewishka with his inhuman massive-yet-ridiculous proportions all the way to cyborg-Francis taking a break from being dead in the Fox X-men universe to play the bullish blow-hard Zapan (played excellently in a love-to-hate way).All this gushing aside this film is by no means perfect. The pacing of the film switches at times from slow to breakneck speed with frequent (though not necessarily badly done) exposition dumps. This is probably because the film adapts a good chunk of its original source manga into a relatively short amount of time (although given how this film was kind of a big gamble even with it being a James Cameron project it is possible that they wanted to include as much story as possible in case it failed to do well). The romance between Alita and Hugo isn't terribly engaging for me (though that could simply be my taste in films not really including romance) although their character interactions are endearing and I have seen far worse romantic sub-plots in blockbuster films (looking at you Aquaman and Attack of the Clones). And the end is obvious sequel-baiting although almost all the plot-threads are neatly tied-up by the end of the film so those worrying at unfinished arcs needn't worry too much in that respect.Ultimately in comes down to this: If you're a fan of anime or manga in general you owe it to yourself to see this film. If you're a fan of superhero films and want to see something a little different then I'd also highly recommend it. If you want to see a James Cameron passion project come to beautiful fruition go and check it out (he'd probably appreciate it given its spent potentially 20 years languishing in development-hell)."
"I can� 1/2(TM)t wait to see this film it looks interesting and I love manga."
"Alita Battle Angel isNot only is it a Visual show it is also the clear example of a good adaptation of the Japanese world"
"Loved this movie. Enjoyable from beginning to end."
"this was a GREAT movie! the thing ilked the most about this movie was alittas chachter. she was innocent yet strong and i liked the visuals. the only reason not a 5 is the editing. it was kind of jarring."
"i`d be the first to admit Cameron could have done better plot ideas the evil guy. but... it`s the best adaption i`ve seen in a long time on the big screen. good enough to pay 15$. there are some moments that feel too bright in an american kind of way. But they took alita and made her as impulsive as the original character. But she fought no evil. even at the dark times the movie feels optimic.Hugo was too low on character building. he feels one dimension.The movie shows promise... hopefully they won`t drop the ball at the second movie."
"This movie encompasses the reason people go to the movies! I cant get enough Alita Battle Angle"
"A good movie with excellent special effect. Look forward to a sequel (if they decide to make one)"
"Best adaptation of a Manga ever! An absolute must see soo much heart great action amazing acting the THE EFFECTS just wow."
"Went and seen it with my girlfriend. We both liked it."
"Alita shows how far a good story can go and how important it is to develop your characters though there were moments of confusion. Alita was both beautiful and action packed. The lead actor for Alita did a fantastic job and the character itself was a strong-willed warrior and never shied away from that narrative. There was a real sense of danger for the people around Alita (though I never felt like Alita herself was at any real risk) and the movie didn't hesitate to kill off a character(s). The world it takes place in is actually incredibly interesting and I wanted to learn everything I could about it as soon as I watched it. Critics scored a bit low on this one make sure to check out the audience reviews everyone loves it and for good reasons. Can't wait to see the next one!"
"Excellent. Some new elements in the story regarding the manga but it's an awesome movie!"
"Alita was awesome. The details and the Fx its incredible. Robert Rodriguez and James Cameron is the perfect combination."
"I can understand if the movie does not fit your style but to say that the story and the visuals are bad as some "critics" have mentioned is just a big fat lie. The visuals in this movie are spectacular! And the story while sometimes goofy and cheesy still had depth and was still enjoyable.."Sufficiently entertained"???? LOL! Everybody that I have spoken to who has seen the movie was blown away with the fight scenes and the movie as whole.. Makes you wonder what these "critics" were expecting to see... or maybe that's the problem? Maybe they came in "expecting" to see something that was not there?BTW although I watch some anime I have not seen or read Alita Battle Angel before so I am not some cult raver. My opinion on the movie is purely based on what I felt as I exited the theater."
"Amazing movie! Epic and compelling story!"
"I don't trust critics anymore"
"Great Story! Don�(TM)t let the rotten tomatoes score fool you! Great date movie or even if you want to take your daughter to see a great female lead in a movie. I took my wife and daughter and they both loved it ."
"Story was disjointed and filled with plot wholes. Effects were great. Acting was mailed in."
"I have never read Gunm and I went to watch Alita Battle Angel without knowing anything about it. I really loved this movie and I hope they greenlight some sequels."
"Don't listen to the critics with their heads stuck up their arse this movie is amazing and deserves your money. 8.7/10"
"great anime adaptation"
"This film kind of came out of the clear blue sky for me. I knew there was a very popular Manga thanks to my son but this film just flipped my wig. Robert Rodriguez + James Camron + Christoph Waltz = one great movie."
"Battle Angel= Awesome"
"I have seen Alita and it is beautiful heartfelt story. I am definitely going back for a possible sequel."
"A compelling protagonist you can get behind with an artist's attention to detail with regards to the sets and characters. A couple of weak casting choices and my problem with Rodriguez's pacing stops it getting a perfect score. Recommended!"
"Alita is one of the best characters to make its way to the big screen in a long time. The film is visually spectacular simply breathtaking. The story is beautiful and touching and the ending leaves you craving for that second part. Cannot recommend enough. Amazing."
"Seeing this on Wednesday with two others based solely on YouTube reviews and word of mouth. I dont pay attention to critics since for the most part their reviews dont correspond to the enjoyment of a movie."
"While Alita is not perfect story wise and has some script and pacing issues it delivers a fantastic world and brings a long time favourite character to life."
"This movie deserves more love!"
"I do not know why but I was entertained. Is that not the purpose of any movie? Thought the CGI for Alita's character was great. One could feel the innocence of that teen. Yes the story has been told millions of times but I enjoyed the movie. We saw it in 3D and thought the motion was smooth not fuzzy like other heavily CGI movies. I did not know any of the back stories but that was fine you do not need to be a big Anime/Manga fan to enjoy this movie."
"Looking forward to this one."
"To date the best manga to live action movie ever... this was amazing . Must see!!!!"
"First exposure to this show but it was a very fun movie definitely recommended"
"Awesome movie a must see for any fan of manga or even if your not a fan go see it!!!"
"What this movie able to achieve in terms of visual is already enough to certified as fresh loved it!"
"Had no plan to watch. But as reviews started rolling in by the audience. I and my friend immediately booked the ticket. and I am glad I did. But I regret not booking it in Imax :("
"This movie is amazing! I saw it twice. Didn't expect to love it so much but it reminds me of what going to movies used to be like for me! The awe and getting lost in the story. I didn't feel like I was being lectured to either which is always a plus! James Cameron and Robert Rodriguez have delivered what is ironically the best heroine in a decade despite not being a feminist agenda movie. I don't understand the people that think this movie sexualizes Alita in any way just because she has the ideal body type for her style of fighting yet praise Captain Marvel for being a feminist icon when Disney & Marvel hired a BUTT DOUBLE to very clearly sexualize her character. Alita is the kind of hero I want to see more of. One that earns her awesomeness through the struggle of a hero's journey. I've seen it twice! Worth it in 3D and 4D! Going to go see it again this weekend with some friends that haven't seen it yet!"
"It is a very interesting science fiction movie. Loved almost everything. Only disappointed by the ending as it left many unaware questions."
"Can't wait to see it"
"Had me really hooked great film really loved it to be honest . Wasn't expecting much but the final product was a brilliantly made action film."
"Had me really hooked great film really loved it to be honest . Wasn't expecting much but the final product was a brilliantly made action film."
"Next Chapter Please!"
"Ok ok we need to talk about the plot in this movie. I watched the movie and was baffled to see that the movie doesn� 1/2 1/2(TM)t follow the traditional plot of the story hitting a climax and everything falling into place. Evidently Alita: Battle Angel has some sort of plot because the movie is really good and this is James Cameron we are taking about. Knowing how good James Cameron is I realize that he had to be following some sort of plot line. All great writers know following a plot in their stories in order to keep their audience engaged. So which plot is Alita following? I considered this for a while and then struck me James Cameron used the Yes but...No and... plot line. The Yes but...No and... plot is were the audience is present a question that either ends with a yes or no and a way for another question to be presented. In some cases James Cameron answered questions with a No but...or Yes and... but he still uses the plot structure. However using this kind of plot is really hard to pull off because the a writer could find him or herself asking questions and answering them with no way to end the story. That is why James Cameron is so brilliant because not only does he use this type of plot well but he found a way to end the movie with the audience hungering for more. This may very much change the way we tell stories in movies. I definitely recommend watching this movie for the plot alone. I loved the acting the fighting and CGI in this movie too."
"Some pacing problems aside Alita is hands down an amazing and true to the source adaptation of the manga before it. I had been waiting for this ever since I found out Cameron bought the rights back in the 90's. I had incredibly high hopes for this film because of that fact and seriously doubt it would live up to my hype. And it did. Will be seeing it multiple times."
"I'm Alita comic fan and this movie made me satisfied as expected."
"Good film with great special effect and mostly good story. Though the last 5 minutes should have been changed to not be sequel bate."
"I was honestly blown away by this film. There were a few narrative decisions that I have liked fleshing out further but still a solid film worth a watch!"
"fantastic rendering coming out of the animated film version of the original story! Top CGI going on here with a deep relateable and interesting human main character. Loved it!"
"Really good CGI and very faithful to the original material. Some interpretations do not quite fit so good. And some moments that should be emotional kind that disconnected me from the story. But is a very good achievement in Hollywood. Good story. Some casting issues. Christopher Waltz seems odd in that role sometimes specially in the action scenes."
"This film is what a powerful female lead is all about; Strong and most importantly likeable and someone you can relate to. There is very little you can find wrong in this film but what i think will appeal the most to the general audience is: This film is 100% free of SJW politics virtue signaling identity politics mary sues toxic feminisim and every other forced leftist idea that has made entertainment in this country toxic. It's just a good story a good film and it stands on it's own for what it is. I recommend it for someone who wants to just go see a film and not have some moonbat's ideas shoved down your throat. It's film the way film used to be; and still should be if hollywood would pull its collective head out of its collective... well you. Of course Critics hate it but then again it's not a Disney film so the shills can't say good things about it or Disney will take away their privaliges. Word of advice for readers; look at the audience scores. Critics are predominantly liars looking for favors to generate more revenue in clicks. The entire film critic industry has become obsolete and should just be done away with. Alita: Battle Angel gets a Solid A and leaves us with a couple of questions to ask:"Captain Who? Brie what; Cheese?""
"Overall a super fun action packed movie. The romance in the film is the one thing that I think could have been better but I am going to put that blame onto Keean Johnson just really being bland. I think it would have been fine in the hands of a different actor. I will be going to see it again and I do hope we get a sequel as there is clearly more story to tell."
"Absolutely blown away! Was the movie perfect no but as a longtime fan I feel like they did about as good as possible to make a compelling movie that honors the original material. Rosa's performance as Alita was outstanding! Please go and support this movie and not listen to the garbage critics!"
"Fun. I enjoyed it from start to finish."
"It is a really good movie with dome good special effects and a very interesting story"
"So true to the source material... How could Hollywood possible make something true to the source material? This should not be possible?! Best timeline!"
"The trailers didn't show the love story. To me it was a mediocore love story with good action scenes. (I don't read the anime so I didn't know it was a love story)"
"The 2 1/2 stars i gave are for the first half of the movie. AMAZING! World building was amazing Alita was adorable and you wanted to watch her succeed. The villains are definitely interesting in the beginning. After a bar brawl the night shift of the editing team walked in and the hack job that ensued was such a confusing lamentable mess that it just let me wondering about all the unanswered questions that were left hanging there. Also right after that characters started immediately doing things you wouldn't see them doing. All the motivations that were created in the first half were gone replaced by i don't even know what. Ending was NOT satisfying. I'll probably actually buy this movie and then watch the first half. I want to know about this world that was created but i just don't know if i trust the team behind it to properly carry out James Cameron's vision."
"I am a long time fan of the Manga and the OVA that came out after. Alita was a fantastic version of both. They managed to make it fairly true to the source material. Honestly it is one of the best film to anime adaptations that has been made and that includes the ones coming out of Japan. Alita is a strong female lead that grows visibly in a complex world. Visually of course it is stunning but the heart that it shows brings it over the top. It is fairly violent despite being marketed largely to younger audiences so I wouldn't recommend it for your kids (my children won't be watching it anytime soon). If you are a fan of anime at all it is well worth the watch."
"See this instead of Captain Marvel."
"Sleeper hit surprised that it's not blowing up"
"See captain marvel this is how you make a good movie with a 'female' leading character xD lol cut the bs from being your main focus and boom good movie."
"If Jason Bourne and Ip Man entered the Matrix...If you like the action fight scenes and visuals of all 3 then you'll want to check this for sure."
"fine movie and great story and full of action and no political propaganda!I am also pleased with the players who played well in the ALITA: BATTLE ANGEL! I'm going to watch ALITA: BATTLE ANGEL again in 3D !!!"
"Por fin una adaptación de un manga bien hecha por Hollywood."
"These critics are idiot."
"Great adoption of a manga... Finally. Good job. Hope for more of these. Will watch it for the second time tonight."
"Fantastic action. Great characters. Visually stunning. Skip Captain Larson and watch this instead."
"Fan of the manga fan of the movie. Not sure why there is hate. This Alita was done pretty well. I'm looking forward to a sequel."
"A visual feast see it in 3D Imax ...the world of Atila is Bladerunner Esq and does not disappoint action on full throttle mode hope there's a sequel in the planning."
"Its REALLY good! A harmonious balance between a love story incredible fight scenes and time was taken to build the plot and development of Alita. I never knew it was a Manga till now. I loved Avatar and this is just as good! Hope for number 2 in the years to come."
"best waifu in last 10 years"
"Waaaaaaayyyyyyy better than the critics say I was fully immersed into the world they've created. Yes there are some goofy plot stuff but you wont care about while being mesmerized by Alita!"
"A faithful adaptation of Alita. Long awaited and happy with the result. Don� 1/2 1/2(TM)t listen to the mainstream critics."
"The question you got to ask yourself do you want to be entertained? That is what you will get with this movie. I never review movies but after almost not watching it myself because of the negative narrative that the critics put out there with their reviews. I feel that the problem with critics in most cases is that they look for things to criticize it is no longer about just plain old entertainment and fun. I've read the manage decades ago and watch the anime but to be honest I barely remember anything about it and even though I wanted this movie to do well because I am an Anime fan (if you can even call me that since I've gone for years without watching any) i still was willing to pass on this movie if I felt like I wouldn't enjoy it... and oh boy I am glad that I didn't pass on it I am glad I watched it and I am glad that it was made the way it was made. Do yourself a favor and judge this one for yourself because all of us have opinions but the one that matters most is the one we have ourselves and I just don't think that most people will be disappointed unless it is your job to be disappointed."
"Great movie. Might go see it again"
"Yet another movie where critics hate and fans love. It wasn't perfect but I really base my reviews off of how I feel at the end of the film. Felt awesome! The action was amazing love Alita cannot wait to see more. I really hope it succeeds in that we get to have a sequel. Sure it was cheesy at parts but regardless it was a super fun awesome film."
"Good watch much better than i was expecting"
"Visually rich fantastic action sequences but all in service to telling a story with a lot of heart. Loved it."
"Alita is the best cinema surprise I've had in quite a while. I went into the theatre expecting a shallow explosion-fest of mindless robot fights. What I got was a fascinating and well fleshed out sci-fi world a good story and characters that grew and developed and were likeable. Despite sometimes falling into melodrama (possibly due to its roots in anime) this is probably one of the best and most enjoyable science-fiction films in years."
"This is such a visually stunning movie. Rosita Salazar is phenomenal in the lead role and deserves much more recognition. Definitely worth multiple watches. Please make a sequel."
"This movie exceeded my expectations! I loved it!"
"Great adaptation of the Comic/Manga to film. I liked that they showed Alita's growth after re-birth/recovery from wide-eyed (pun intended) child adolescent and then adult-ish. I did miss all the quirky characters that were in the books."
"Great movie would have preferred a more mature envisioning but that might come with the next installment."
"Another case of critics hating something fans love. It's almost like there's a disconnect. I'll see it ASAP. Because that tells me it's good."
"I've been twice on this movie and i'm gonna see it again.I hope that Alita make a lot of money and Rodrigez with Cameron will make Next episode of this story :)"
"It is pretty good. The visuals are great and the premise is interesting."
"Great movie ! Awesome visuals ! Don't listen to the critics. A must see !"
"Best sci-fi and manga adaptation to date! Movie has lots of takeaways for everyone of all ages. Everyone should give it a chance and go see it! You definitely won't regret it!"
"Enjoyable as a manga adaptation."
"Visually impressive. The Alita actor and character were seamless. It was an introductory movie that I am guessing will have two more parts so this movie ends were the story is just getting started."
"Huh... for once I disagree with both the professional critics (Currently at 59% approval rating) and the audience score (currently at 93% approval rating). I think the truth is somewhere in the middle.The universe of Alita I thought was really quite interesting and has some great things in it worth revealing. Throughout the movie I was eager to hear more about it. What was the war about? Why did it end? What happened to the losing side? Why are these technologically advanced ancient ships lying around unscavenged after 300 years? Where does the money to pay Bounty Hunters who police the cities come from? So many little details not answered that I was craving to know.I think my main problem with Alita was that it felt like they were trying to cram way too much into a single movie rather than spreading her story out over say a trilogy (which I think would have worked much better overall). The movie would have been much better if they had taken their time on introducing the world developing certain characters beyond 2 dimensions spent more time on "world building" and Alita slowly learning about the world around her and how she fit into it. I say this because the pace that the movie was forced to move at meant many characters development and the motivations behind their actions was frequently lost and sometimes just didn't make any sense (Like when Alita was going to play the Dangerball game thingy her adopted father had previously indicated twice that he was totally against the game completely yet without any explaination he is kitting Alita out for her to play it?). There were a few too many of these weird unexplained moments throughout the movie that just felt wrong out of place inconsistant to the story or without any natural progression.Like many the "romance" thing just didn't work for me at all (I audibly groaned out loud in the cinema at least 3 times without meaning to). The weird attempted "Twilight" moments really fell flat and in general my opinion is that it was a waste of time when there was so much more interesting in the Alita universe that was barely given any screentime at all. It also would have made much more sense for their relationship to be more of a developing "curiosity" thing than a developing "love" thing. With that curiosity developing into an acknowledgement that they liked each others company and the things they were teaching each other. This direction would have made much more sense for a relationship developing between a fullbodied amnesiac cyborg and a human than a luke warm attempted "love interest" storyline.On the positive side overall the character of Alita was pretty damn good (apart from a couple of weird out of place dialogue "speeches"). Her voice definitely suited the character plus she looked awesome the only thing not quite working for me being her teeth animation occassionally not being quite right (but I still haven't put my finger on why I thought that). But everything else was damn near perfect. The world itself looks pretty cool and intricate even if we don't get to see enough of it. Some of the fight sequences are outstanding and the way Alita moves feels organic and has the feeling of weight behind each movement.The almost unspoken about "background" story of 300 years before and why the world was the way it is now are what I found to be the things I was most curious about in the whole movie but these unfortunately were barely touched on at all apart from in brief Alita flash memories. While I get that they were probably trying to save certain "big reveals" for a sequel I still think there were lots of ways to reveal smaller details (general population opinions of what happened peoples beliefs in 300 year old myths etc) that would have been worth delving into in exchange for certain other things that were far less interesting.Anyway overall I think that Alita is a great example of what live action anime is capable of (it finally gives me some hope for the future of some of my favorite animes being realised on the big screen)... but it did trip over itself in a number of places and never quite took full advantage of some of the most interesting aspects of its own universe. For all these reasons I think the 48% critic score is completely wrong. It was a MUCH better movie than that. However likewise I think that the 93% audience score is far too generous... there were way too many missteps and obvious missed opportunities to warrant a score quite that high realistically.I personally think Alita deserves a pretty solid 75% (and I could probably convince myself to go as high as 80%... but definitely no more in its current state)... however that opinion could change with a decent Directors Cut in the future. That being said I am definitely extremely hopeful for a sequel to this movie and that if they make a few better choices with storytelling Alita 2 could be truly awesome. It certainly has the potential to be legendary if handled a little better with a few changes in focus."
"The audience has fallen in love with Alita. That is why this movie works. Alita though she is an android remains to be humanly loveable through her charm and innocence. Alita is not an obnoxious woman who hates on men. She is a sweet little girl who has some special powers. She stands for what is right in a dark unfair world. After watching this movie and hearing all the positive reviews it just shows that moviegoers still enjoy the humanity of a character... how the audience now relates to an android just trying to do the right thing in life and kicking as$ at the same time. Moveigoers are fed up with masculine women portrayed now in super hero movies. Alita is proud of her femininity and doesn't back down to anyone. She is also very sweet and lovable at the same time! Go James Cameron & Robert Rodriguez for having the balls to make this movie. But most of all respect to Yukito Kishiro... the one who started it all by creating such a masterpiece in Alita Battle Angel through the manga.Please take your friends and go see this movie in 3D! It is quite an experience!!!"
"Never mind the Critics BEST MOVIE ADAPTATION from a manga/anime this is how to properly make an japanese adaptation for western audience nevermind those critics most of them are snowflakes or SJWs totally scared of CM flopping WAHAHhh"
"There are a lot of movies out right now but few take advantage of the big screen like this with both sound and stunning visuals. The story was rocky at time but but not so much that it was hard to fallow. I truthfully want to see more movies like this where the we are taken to a rich full world with conflicting motivations and real reasons for those choices. Every major character has a clear reason for being there and why they do things a cretin way in this immersive cyber-punk world. I really liked this movie one for its content but also for finally breaking the curse of Anime to Full Feature western adaptation.Keep movies like this coming James and Rich."
"The casting was amazing. I will go see it in 3d wasnt available in my town opening weekend."
"Really enjoyed the adaptation. Best anime adaptation I have seen."
"Can't wait for the sequel."
"Great movie critics are a bunch of morons don't listen to them. Audience score is on point"
"While there are many many comparisons you can make with the animation movie Astroboy Alita Battle Angel delivers a very gratifying action adventure that is clearly an intro into a planned franchise. The visuals are amazing the combat is very well orchestrated and while you can see where the plot is going (as well as a very obvious death) the journey is fun and enjoyable. Worth the price of admission. A great candidate for springing a few bucks more for 3D"
"Saw it. Fan of the original comic/manga. Thought it was great."
"Very good movie. Hope to see a continuation of the story."
"This movie is soooo AWESOME. The only problem I have is that it sets up for a sequel. This is a bad thing for me because I CANT wait."
"Fast paced action with a lot of feeling and decent character building. CGI can get a little much but well done and doesn� 1/2(TM)t take you out of the movie experience."
"Best CGI fight scenes in movie history."
"Excellent movie! Good story great FX and seemed true to the Manga original. Just what I wanted out of this movie."
"Nice movie. Good cast. Almost perfect cgi. 2 hours of fun. Strong woman main without any sjw agenda bs to be seen.Watch this a second time instead of wasting your time with Captain Marvel."
"Ok so went to see the movie today to be honest i liked it i remember reading the manga and loving the story and mostly the setting due to growing up around Cyberpunk 2020. now the movie has great action scenes gives a solid feel to how androids (cyber enhanced humans) would look and feel if in a fight also how it would look in real life which in turn makes a good film to watch just for that. now in terms of the lead and the other main characters some are good some yea no reason being that i am pointing out is Alita and the boy (can't remember his name right now) feels cheesy and forced it felt awkward leaving a bad taste in your mouth mean while the doctor (same as above sorry) feels natural and kind of father and daughter deal which is nice and makes her into a person that we will grow to love while others you hate as much as the protagonist does. now for story it does feel good however feels rushed very rushed from my memory there was more of the beginning and development for the characters i may be wrong it has been awhile since reading the manga however i don't like how it just jumps from this to then that and then there it makes it into a sort of "huh." however i do recommend watching it if you wanna enjoy a good movie for action. Also for a new series to follow for a movie as it does leave a cliffhanger not a like oh my god must watch but more hunger games type of ending. for a movie that has come from a anime and manga it did do well i might add i could name a few that didn't if this does not convince you to watch it then how about this if you are a technophile then this is for you to watch ^^ i give it the stars i give for the action however the story and few bad parts just left a bad taste now it can just be it trying to move it along to get to the meat and bones however it just wasn't done right sadly or just me looking at it wrong."
"Entertaining movie with great visuals. Not a fan of anime but you don't have to to enjoy this movie."
"This movie is awesomeMy father doesnt like anime but he got so into this movie he said when we were leaving that there better be a damn sequel :)I was worried that the trailers were not representativeIt was awesome - going to watch it again"
"Don't listen to the critics. Are the story or ideas new or genius? No and who cares. It is well executed and thoroughly enjoyable. If you want some sci-fi action with a heart and little a bit of mystery and intrigue I doubt you'll be disappointed. Far better than Wonder Woman e.g which was borderline cringe-worthy but somehow garnered a 93% rating."
"Alita is strong and curious. Alita does not bash weaker characters even men. Be like Alita."
"I watched in imax 3dloving it. She's is deathly and super cuteIf you are not watching this movie then it's your loss you are not going to enjoy this movie on tv or laptop or tablet."
"I'm a huge fan of Alita! I've got all the graphic novels the OVA on VHS and have been anticipating the movie ever since James Cameron announced he'd love to make the adaptation in the early 2000s. It took over a decade to come to fruition. Rosa Salazar was perfect casting - not only does she look like Alita with her dark hair big eyes and angelic face she embodied Alita made her so real vulnerable and also extremely powerful and determined just like how Yukito Kishiro envisioned his Gally in Gunnm. I don't want to spoil any of the film so I'll just say this: Alita is discovered in a scrapyard by a cybernetic doctor (Christoph Waltz) who rebuilds her. Alita is an amnesiac and needs to find out who she is. She makes friends and enemies on her journey and discovers that she's not just an insignificant girl; she has immensely powerful fighting abilities. During the film she slowly regains some of her memories and realises her values to protect those she cares about and to "not stand by in the presence of evil".The performance capture technology is absolutely sublime; they captured Rosa's every facial expression perfectly. Combining that with Rosas's training in martial arts and a skilled stunt-double the CGI performance capture technique that James Cameron pioneered whilst making Avatar was perfectly utilised for Alita Zapan and the other Cyborgs. Cameron wanted to make Alita: Battle Angel in the mid 2000s but felt the performance capture technology wasn't up to scratch; he used that technology to create the Na'vi in 2009's Avatar and we all know how good that looked making over 2 billion dollars worldwide.The tech's gotten so much more advanced since 2009 so it was time to use it to create Alita as a fully Computer Generated character complete with nuanced facial expressions body language and those controversial eyes (I had no problems with that since Alita is not exactly Human and it made sense to have her eyes so large to pay tribute to the manga).James Cameron and Robert Rodriguez doyennes of action/sci-fi cinema compressed 2 and a half graphic novel volumes into a 2 hour movie including the main themes of Alita's journey - and related her story to that of Ido Zapan Hugo and Vector's.Including the violent sport of Motorball was essential to Alita's character development. Not to mention the spectacular use of CGI to convey this kinetic violent version of Roller Derby. The love care and effort behind making Alita: Battle Angel cannot be sniffed at. Not only is it a gift to Alita's fans it's a cornerstone in Computer Generated Imagery and combining that with a story of self-discovery and empowerment that everyone can relate to it also honours Yukito Kishiro the masterful creator of Alita the Battle Angel."
"Lovely movie large eyes were not bothering me as much as I thought good pacing and the character development is wel done. Highly recommend it"
"I have no idea why the so-called critics panned this movie. If you are an avid moviegoer as I am you will be thrilled and engaged the entire time. Well worth the money to see it in IMAX 3D for the stunning visuals and unbelievable action pieces.Alita is an endearing strong and determined character and Rosa Salazar just does a great job in bring her character to life.What also helps are unbelievable action pieces gorgeous visuals and an immersive world.See it on the biggest screen possible in 3D!"
"Robert Rodriguez and James Cameron + A great cast = Quality"
"Best movie i have seen in years. Best adaptation of an anima we have got. And it is great as a stand alone action movie."
"Fantastic adaptation. Visually stunning the only criticism which could be levelled from my point of view was the lack of gore and a world which was maybe a little too nice when it should have been a little bit grubbier. Don't like cliffhangers especially before the sequel has been greenlit. However as endings go the film doesn't leave you hanging."
"One of the most fascinating and exciting movies of this decade. The two newest trailers for this movie were the most perfectly edited ones I've ever seen so I just had to watch this movie. The experience was so amazing that I had to watch it again after just two days. Simply one of the best movies out there and one of my new favorites. The CGI and SFX are out of this world and the way the story ends just screams for a sequel. This movie has a soul."
"I thought the movie was Fantastic."
"Much Much better than critics say. A lot of fun - with some of the best action i've see in years. Alita ROCKS. Cameron and Rodriguez have hit it out of the Park!!!!! Highly Recommended."
"Alita: Battle Angel is awesome. It t took the behemoth of the cosmic wizard of blockbusters James Cameron with the aid of trusty director Robert Rodriguez to break the curse of bad manga/anime movies. But oh boy the curse was not only broken but disintegrade and wiped from existence.If you like the cyberpunk genre you have your fix and it sets up a high bar to be topped off in the coming years. If you like action adventure you are also in for a treat. Why the critics response so much lower than the general audience? Critics gravitate two kinds of responses: either holding off towards tradition of the craft or looking for the next big thinng. Somehow they failed to perceive the good things in Alita: Battle Angel. Be it for lack of familitarity with the source material or the cyberpunk genre itself it is one of the cases where there is a strong difference of opinion where the audience is saying very clearly: this is a very good movie!It polishes the techniques of transferring the actor's performance into CG characters which will certainly be used on the Avatar sequels. While not all material needs to become a franchise in this case the original artwork has a lot to offer more than can fit in a single movie. The movie does a good job to establish a first chapter not trying to cram too everything of the story - even then t's still a little bit busy at times.I thoroughly enjoyed this and I am already looking forward to the next two movies as stated by James Cameron: Alita: Fallen AngelAlita: Avenging AngelThough whether they will ever hapen depends on the financial success of the first one."
"Seen it. Really bad. Jame Cameron low point. The movie just never connects on an emotional or for that matter logical level with the audience."
"Amazing movie with insane visuals. One of the best manga adaptations we have ever seen."
"This was a great movie. While the story can seem a little bit condensed the characters are great animation was great the actions sequences were GREAT. I don't go to the theater often but I would go again to see this."
"Loved the movie nd am waiting for the sequel"
"Im a fan of the anime. The story was adapted spot on being true to the original manga. Cinematography is amazingly glorious. Battle scenes were surprisingly better than the anime. Being a fan of how alita looks in the anime. Translation to live action is spot on almost like the creators of this movie are speaking to alitas fans and reaching out to those that do not know it exists. Dont listen to critics. My family does not know the anime and they have still enjoyed it. Dont know what others are ranting about. Apparently nothing is too perfect for them"
"I love this movie! It has a bit of everything! great story line. the characters are relatable and believable. It takes on a journey from start to finish!"
"You did it Cameron. You made a promise and you kept it. You really did. Thank you."
"I really enjoyed this movie and hope they make another. Its not perfect but no movie is. Alita is a bad ass and thats what this movie is about."
"Great movie thoroughly enjoyed it."
"Thoroughly enjoyed every minute"
"I've watched this movie and I WANT MORE!This movie is amazing Alita is a fucking great character that doesn't get bogged down by social standing and feminist agenda. She genuinely is a good character like Ellen Ripley from Alien."
"Fantastic movie. CGI is out of this world."
"Great movie you know when they done right and follow the sauce material."
"Very good movie! It's funny how critics on Rotten Tomatoes are more driven by political agenda then caring about honest reviews..."
"Definitely a movie worth watching. Listening to the "Professional Critics" is completely useless. The audience score speaks for itself."
"Watched it. Loved it."
"Loved it no complaints."
"This has become one of my favorite movies of all time! Dont trust the critics!! First off the cgi is some of the best I� 1/2(TM)ve ever seen and probably THE best. The story and world is amazing and since seeing the movie I� 1/2(TM)ve basically become a fanboy of this the manga and ova. I can not recommend this enough. I hate 3D most of the time but seeing this in 3D was one of the best movie going experiences ive has ever. Do yourself a favor and go watch this masterpiece."
"The first half 45 minutes to an hour of the movie dragged a little as the story took time to unfold but then Rosa Salazar� 1/2(TM)s Alita took the movie by the scruff of its neck and it reall became a great sci-if auctioner. Mesmerizing visual effects and tremendous action. Alita herself was incredibly rendered and Rosa Salazar was great in the role. A:BA is worth watching in the biggest IMAX screen possible. The only real negative is that the film has an abrupt left me wanting more finale. I could� 1/2(TM)ve watched three hours of this as is the case with most James Cameron films (Robert Rodriguez is very good at the helm)."
"Fantastic enjoyable film"
"Brilliant movie stunning visuals and beautiful world. Nice and compelling story."
"Pure cyberpunk action romp. It ain't Shakespeare but it's not trying to be either. Rodriguez and Cameron give the source material the respect it deserves and the action and visuals more than compensate for the few tiny less-than-stellar moments."
"Don't believe the "critics". This is one of the very rare movies that get you connected with the characters and the (awesome) action."
"Loved it! Wanted to see more! Did not know there was a Manga of this - i intend to watch the original animation and look into reading the graphic novels as well. Would happily watch more movies in the series and would even love to see a prelude of the Great War - please support please watch!p.s. As usual the Liberal douche bag critics shitting on this good movie please ignore them and go and watch this movie. Please support. thank you."
"One of the best movies I've ever seen! I'll be seeing this one again and again and again!"
"Amazing performance from Salazar with a well crafted world and story. Action scenes are incredible. Must see."
"An excellent movie. Made right!!!"
"This movie is greatest anime adaptation of all time. Don't believe those critics. Go see the movie by yourself."
"All I ask of movies is to be entertained by them and Battle Angel Alita thoroughly entertained me. Alita is visually spectacular to watch and it adapts its source material respectfully and with a bold sense of love and passion. The world building is phenomenal and Alita herself is a memorable and amazing lead character whom your heart can't help but love and root for. Battle Angel Alita is definitely worth giving a chance and watching. It's an enjoyable fantastic watch!"
"Has the best cameo from all the cameos Rico from Starship Troopers. That movie by the way has a higher rating 62 %. WTF ??? Best movie I have seen in 20 plus years without doubt. Praying for sequel and aint at all religious thats how much I want it... Also her name is 99 would you believe. Sorry about this review chief."
"Great movie. Felt exaclty like an anime . Great job Rosa salazar."
"One of the best movie ever!"
"Amazing!! A must watch in 3D"
"The movie has great visual affects and the story is just amazing. A must see movie!"
"This looks terrific. I hope the plot is good but if not i expect i will enjoy it as a popcorn flick."
"This is an incredible movie. It packs absolutely stunning CGI and such charming characters. Old themes of good versus evil discovery of love between a girl and a boy and kick ass action are presented with 26th century action. I was totally geeking out. Wow this was a complete and awe inspiring film. I loved it. I would give it six stars if I could. You must see this movie in 3D while it is still there!"
"I don't know what the "critics" are saying. This movie was fun and I definitely recommend it to anyone that likes some action or is into anime."
"I don't know what the "critics" are saying. This movie was fun and I definitely recommend it to anyone that likes some action or is into anime."
"An anime that actually works and faithful to the source material while doing the impossible thing by keeping the anime original essence."
"Awesome 3D movie..great story...great action."
"Fantastic. Good wholesome story with tough themes good character arcs humour and amazing action and design. Never read the manga but loved the movie."
"Brilliant film and a new cinematic experience"
"Really enjoyed this movie. Never seen Alita before the trailers and purposely did not go check out the Manga but somehow I knew it would be great. It left me wanting more and wanting to see it again. It renewed my faith in the film making industry to make great Sci-fi. SADLY once Disney gets their claws into it I fear we will never get a decent sequel that is not an SJW filled mess. Is this a perfect movie... Who the Hell cares? It is a great movie! Critics should shut up and rate it in the context of what it is Action sci-fi at its best. Five stars instead of 4.5 just to help offset their non-sense. Go see it and lose yourself in it."
"Very good story and excellent CGI. This is really a movie that can be enjoyed by everybody."
"Don� 1/2(TM)t trust the critics. Alita is a fun movie worth seeing on the big screen. Look at the audience score."
"I have never vote for a movie. But Alita is just amazing and wanna to let everyone know this and go and enjoy this movie!"
"epic movie! special fx very-very good. the manga is brought to life"
"If a movie is meant to entertain then Alita succeeds. It's an origin story they are always a little messy. But the action scenes make up for it in the end."
"An other proof that critics in the media don't understand anything anymore we had multiple exemple for it a and when you have one critic out of two saying this movie is garbage but yet 93 pourcent of the people who saw it liking it... I mean come on RT do your job and put the user score before the critics they have no knowledge of anything for most of them they usually don't know what they are talking about and usually the only thing they do is watching movies for free and shitting on them.It's a good movie a good adaptation deal with it critics."
"Good. Interesting. Should watch."
"This was amazing film i thought theme was very interesting this what in powering women is showing how can actually show strength in steady make excuses not achieve though our own merit aside that it was fun and exciting see women go from the dumps literally and be hero of her own story."
"i get some of the fairer critical reviews complaining about the dialogue and maybe the romance. What i dont get are the ones completely crapping on the film saying it doesnt make sense or the characters are bland or the coudnt get invested into the characters... what damn film where they watching?? clearly there is an agenda to turn people off this film so it doesnt do well.. so their agenda filled captain marvel does well. hows that going for you critics???"
"Never been a fan of critic reviews but having read a few negative posts I was a little hesitant having seen the trailer and really wanted to see this film. Regardless I went and was fully engaged and entertained by the story characters and storyline. The action is interspersed with a conflicting plot of love and betrayal between the main protagonists. Obviously with a story that has no precedent you cannot cover all aspects of the storyline but all th main plot points have sufficient cover so you can follow and it is in these flashbacks that the appetite is whet for further instalments in this tale. Special effects are amazing and it is hard to dispute that Alita with her big eyes is less than real the clutch of bad guys and girls also look convincing with each clonk and crank of their robotics. You can feel a nod to the anime roots of the story not solely with Alita�(TM)s overly large eyes and any fan of the genre will feel all of these moments. Overall the critics are overly snobbish with negative reviews and seem to forget that film and the cinema experience is about entertainment and Alita delivers in spades."
"I am seeing it next week after htyd 3"
"A film that supplies beautiful visuals some bad dialogue a forced love story and one amazing character that you will not be able to take your eyes off of."
"Great movie the cgi will blow you away"
"This movie was soooo good. I would type more if my finger was wrapped up. Maybe I'll come back and edit this in a few days lol"
"it's a wonderful film. i liked what the story teller was trying to present to the audience. whether or not it came off perfect is another thing but you need to get into the story. the pacing was not to the point but it never felt like a drag at any point. Very good film"
"One of the best movie I've seen over the past 4 years definitely the best movie I've seen in 2019 so far. I ain't and will not forget this movie ever! Everything I've always wanted in a movie are in Alita: Battle Angel especially the fighting scenes OMG!! The fighting and her moves were just phenomenal and amazing I even felt butterflies in my stomach during the fight scenes. Alita's back story of herself is incredible shes so unique and we'll trained for combat and her characteristic is just astonishing it amazes me. The romance and the whole entire story was well done. I Thank You James Cameron and Robert Rodriguez for creating such a master piece it has motivated so much I thank you. I rate this movie a 9 and a half out of 10 even though the limit is 5 I gave a 5 out of 5-5. Hoping slot of people will watch this movie so a sequel will come. Please everyone rate this movie a 5 - 5 and spread the word to the people you know so Alita 2 sequel will be made. Thank you everyone who helped making this movie its just WOW! absolutely phenomenal. Alita 2 here we come."
"I am a fan of the manga and really liked the movie :)"
"Great Action Sci-fi! Entertainment from start to finish. I hope there's a part 2."
"It's really fun to watch.The looks are awesome and its pretty close to the Manga."
"O.M.G. What a Ride! Please please please Part 2 a.s.a.p."
"almost reat adoptation...I have no issues wih some of the stuff i have been seeing other critics been compleining about. the Sexualization of alita. if anything james cameron has down toned this issuein the adaption compared to the manga.what annoyed me somewhat about the adaoptation is the reordering of the scenes of the story making the Alita character become the battle angel to fast I do though have feeling that this is done intentionally to give the adaptation more action as a standa alone movie. this is after all just less than a third of the entire story which is the reason why it's so open ended (just like lord of the rings first part).but other from that I enjoyed every minute of the movie"
"Not Perfect but The Heart of the Manga is captured and Alita is a great relatable Character. And I disnt saw better CGI since Avatar."
"Been waiting a long time to see Alita on the big screen don't listen to these retarded critics. They bitch and moan about every movie that doesn't pander to their insane ideology."
"Fantastic movie! Alita is a great character! I loved her."
"Fantastic. Pity the summary from the "critics" doesn't know the distinguished between special and visual effects. Worth a watch a great role model for young women."
"It did exactly what it set out to do: stay as close to the source material as possible while being entertaining as hell. It might not have been made for everyone but if audience scores are anything to go by it might've found an audience that was desperately needing it."
"Better than I thought it would be"
"Visuallly brilliant and a must in 3D!"
"�>�?��?� �-청 기��?�"
"Wonderful adaptation of the series and remarkable achievement in visuals.. at times hard to remember that it's a CGI character... wonderful world building... can't wait for the next installment... AND NO SJW bullsh*TPaid to see it again... Obviously the critics aren't getting a kickback from this film thus the low scores..."
"It's an excellent movie � 1/2 1/2'"
"I loved it .. first manga adp. that didn't suck"
"Excellent movie! The CGI is top-notch the story & plot is true to the original & fluid throughout...A MUST SEE! Interesting how mainstream media critics bash a movie that doesn't fit their narrative or agenda! Ignore their propaganda BS & listen to the true critics... The movie fans who PAY to watch movies...people like YOU. The Rotten Tomatoes Critics are rotten! Read the fans reviews & make YOUR OWN decision. This movie is smashing the MSM low expectations & with good reason...NO SJW/NPC forced politics!"
"I went into Alita sighing. I am not ashamed to admit I expected a man-bashing feminist movie where all men are bad and all women are victims. However despite this faulty view I discovered that Alita was a very intelligent thought out film. The film starts with the discovery of robot parts which is soon rebuilt into Alita complete with her identity but no memories. Instinctively aggressive Alita finds her comfort in a racing competition and lives the side life of a bounty against the wishes of her adopted father who made her. As the film goes on we discover more of her memories. The film is laden with special effects and action and for all intensive purposes it delivers. It was nice and refreshing and worth repeat viewings."

"Excellent. An Anime adaptation done right. Highly recommended."
"Absolutely stunning from every angle - story acting and effects were surprisingly amazing considering the current state of identity politics which usually dominates the plot of most modern movies (and critics) in order to maintain funding and event invites from certain sectors of leading media organisations. We need more movies like this - anything form of harmless entertainment that riles up social justice extremists is bound to be legendary."
"Man I really wanted to like this movie. The visuals are cool the action is fun the main character is engaging. But James Cameron's script is so so bad. I could tell there's a lot of potential with the source material but this adaptation has some of the worst writing I've seen in a while which doesn't help the actors. Most of the emotional moments fell flat and the pacing was just awful. I wish it was a better movie."
"Excellent movie with strong female lead that didn't need to preach to the audience or degrade the male characters to make her look better. Alita did that all on her own with strong males around her. Saw it in Imax will see again."
"Phenomenal can't wait for Alita 2"
"Just watched it today all I could say is its soo good. I did not know this anime but unlike many other anime adaptation this is one of the best I have ever seen."
"It was a little bit cheesy at points but the animation cinematography and action were all on point. It really gave me a 90s feel which makes sense considering the manga was created in the 90s!"
"I haven't read the original Mangas or watched the OVA and my expectations weren't exactly high before the movie but damn I was amazed how great the movie was. The CGI is solid and the action sequences are just amazing keeping you on the edge of the seat the whole time. Story wise the movie is pretty good too it's shows you Alita's backstory via flashbacks even explains her massive eyes which probably most people wont notice. Performance of the actors was really well done except probably Alita's love intrest. All in all a good movie worth of a sequel best Manga adaptation Hollywood has done I would recommend you watch it even if you haven't read the original comics."
"I thought this movie was going to be a weird comic book thing. I am not really a huge fan of comic books but this was just a great story. And the visuals were amazing. I don't like 3D but it was good in this movie. Way to go."
"This is live action Manga at its best."
"Very true to its base material once again "professional" reviewers just dont get it"
"Trully a great movie. The only complaint i have is that the romance part of the movie felt a little rushed and forced. Besides that it is fantastic. Graphics script is all great!Definitly needs a sequal."
"The critics are being bit*%es as usual. You don't need to know anything about the manga or anime to follow along. Everything is explained. The visuals and effect are among the very best to date. Props to WETA. Cameron + Rodriguez was a great combination. The film never dragged and I was never bored. The world building and detail is impressive. Her eyes are not uncanny valley at all. Once you see how heavily modified other characters are you won't have a problem with it. It's not like they look so strange or too big anyway. They look alright. You forget you are looking at CGI for the most part. The graphics are that good. The action sequences are awesome. The love story could have been handled a little better but it still has a really good charm and heart to it. Alita is a great sweet lovable relatable and badass character unlike another bland generic and boring character that the media is pushing on us and that these same critics will most likely praise and give high ratings for captain marvel. Screw brie larson her sjw feminazi narcissistic bitch attitude and marvel & the media's over pushed attention on her. Everyone should go see Alita instead. The graphics alone are done way better than the CW show levels seen on the captain marvel trailers. F brie larson and captain marvel! Go see Alita as many times as you can so we can get sequels for a legit great character not just for girls and women but for everyone."
"The animation was mindblowing. Some the best action sequences i've seen in a long time. Alita is such an absolutely likable character."
"Aside from awesome world building story and visual effects Alita as character made me love this movie. Alita Battle angel reignites and revitalized my nerdy mind and show me that Hollywood can make a good anime adaptation. After the movie ended it left me wanting more and I want it to be successful so that I can see more of Alita. I love it show much that after few days I convinced my sister and mom to watch it with me and they loved it. I rarely watch movies twice. It is one of the best girl lead role movies as well. The action is breath taking as well as the visuals. The only downside I noticed is the love interest of alita and the main villian I hope they were given more development or screentime. I highly recommend this movie. Please don't listen to those critics and just see this movie."
"Way better than i was expecting usually manga live action Hollywood adaptations are horrible. This movie had good cgi great acting by all involved. They nailed the feel of iron city and the fight scenes were fantastic. Predictable characters are the only downside but even then its only a little.DO NOT TRUST CRITICS SCORES. See it and judge it for yourself you will probably be surprised."
"Even with the writing and narrative structure problems Alita: Battle Angel features groundbreaking visual effects and stunning action sequences to merit an eye-popping distraction"
"I really enjoyed this movie. Full of action and emotion."
"First off yeah its an awesome movie. No agenda powerful character with decent development cool effects. It is not perfect though so the negatives first. Compared to the manga it could have done more. With R rating maybe but more in a sense of character development. The father x daughter relationship is more mellow not that much conflict there. The same goes for the love interest - not a real conflict. And that means not really that much space for character growth. Also there is a plot that we have seen before. Powerful young female against authority social class system oppressing masses below blah blah blah... Considering the 1990 source material these things got borrowed FROM Alita (Gunnm) reworked repeated and pushed to the audiences over and over again. Unfortunately now it drags this movie a bit down. On the plus side they really went there with raw brutality. In the early scenes I though: "Well that's so family friendly I could get my 10 year old niece to see it everybody is smiling happy the sun is shining happy happy happy. Aaaaaand no. No no no no NO. My niece would be traumatized. They did pretty well with the pacing leaving you to want more. There is an obvious build-up for the sequel at the end but not to a horrible degree. It also helps that Alita herself kicks ass. In more than one meaning. Not a Mary Sue not unbeatable not whiny. Can be vulnerable especially through loved ones. BUT. She will not stand in the presence of evil and that's that. Just awesome. Not sexualized in any way shape or form. Although her FULLY NUDE body is in quite a few scenes including trailer I don't think most people will even notice - it's just equipment hardware. Armor screws bolts heart and brain. The more I think about the movie the more I want to see it again. And maybe again. Not a perfect movie not the best movie I've seen. Just awesome."
"The critics were not fans of manga and anime. Trust the 10000 fans who liked the movie over the 247 critics - this is worth watching twice just to take in all the visuals. You're getting what you're expecting - a faithful adaptation of the source material to the big screen. Thank you Robert Laeta and James for doing an amazing movie!"
"To many who may have went to watch this and reviewed it poorly these are probably the same type of people who didnt even realize this was a story spanning several books condensed. Frankly out of all anime/manga adaptions Ive ever seen this was by far one of the best Ive seen. My wife and friend both whom have never seen or heard of Alita prior absolutely loved the movie and were glad I brought them. Theres not to many movies I make a fuss over (good or bad) but I wanted people to know that this movie was worth seeing it. (Also sorry it didnt let me use comma or apostrophe as it kept changing them to TM)"
"Let me start by saying- I am not a very big Manga or Anime fan.BUT Alita is one of the BEST 3D EXPERIENCES I have had since Avatar!It really is nothing but a ridiculously exciting & over the top action & CGI movie!If you love apocalyptic robots & future tech you will be in heaven for the WHOLE 2 hours with this absolute cyber punk classic...Rosa Salazar is totally lovable & fiercely awesome Christoph Waltz & Jennifer Connelly are always a pleasure.I found myself extremely happy with this movie all the way through although it seemed to pack too many endings in like LOTR- Return of the King & not wrap up as cleanly some movies manage to do.Other than that a fun cool & very SWEET film!"
"Fantastic Manga adaptation and really good cyber-punk sci-fi movie. Cant wait for the sequels"
"watched the anime. interested in james cameron's take on such old anime/manga."
"Go set it ....its Not a SJW pander flick!"
"Awesome movie! Don't listen to the critics. They're all shills these days same as our news and they hate the idea of beautiful straight people. Give it a try I guarantee you more character development than the six hours of Star Wars..."
"I went into the movie knowing nothing about the manga or the anime I didn't see the trailers either . & my god!! this film blew my mind. Every scene of it is dripping with visual spectacle. The central character Alita is very likeable. The CGI of this movie is one of the bests I have ever seen. The storyline was average. But the incredible action sequences will blow your mind. This is a must watch movie specially in 3D. Ignore the critics."
"A very good movie... Kept very close to the anime and manga. I loved it."
"Alita goes from na�ve teenage girl to kickass in the first ten minutes. When she recovers the Martian combat suit she is unbeatable. With the Martian sword she is invincible."
"so sick epic film went to the cinema twice"
"Bloody Sensational !"
"A bit cheesy at times but really just added to the charm. Awesome inspiring."
"This movie was really good! I have seen it in theaters 3 times in 3D IMAX and have loved it every time. The visuals were 2nd to none. There was some under-utilization of certain characters and some cheesy dialogue/cuts it was a strong showing of a movie. I strongly suggest you give this movie a shot!"
"This movie is awesome. The critics don't know **** If u wanna see a movie with a compelling story and good character development this one's for u"
"The first perfect adaptation of the Japanese manga."
"One of the best animated movies ever!"
"Battle Angel Alita is beyond a shadow of a doubt the best manga/anime to live action adaptation I've ever seen. If you liked movies like AKIRA Ready Player One Ghost in the Shell Elysium Blade Runner Mad Max or Avatar; this movie might be right down your alley. The futuristic visuals are amazing (watch it in IMAX 3D) and you really feel how alive the city is even though it's a "dystopian future". The fight scenes are way more brutal and gory then you would think for a PG-13 movie but there's a clever reason why the makers get away with it. Even though Alita is CGI it's creepy how lively she looks; to the point you forget about it because you really do get invested in her journey and battle throughout the film. This movie was slated to "bomb" by "experts" but it has done very well and it hasn't premiered in Japan or China yet (which will skyrocket it's box office $$$). So enjoy this film it's really fun and you don't have to know the source material at all it really stands on it's own as a blockbuster sci-fi film. This really gives me hope that a sequel will be in works soon and that finally an anime/manga of AKIRA can come to fruition in the future. FINAL REVIEW: 9 out of 10."
"Refreshing  mostley true tp the source materials and a great group of actors."
"Highly enjoyable cliched movie. It succeeded in drawing me into the story and to want to see more. The technical side of the movie is just... Its Cameronian. Beautiful and unforgettable. Yes there are some storytelling problems and a few nitpicks I could talk about but the movie as a whole persuaded me to not look at them. It was an amazing movie with few flaws and that's it. Hope they will make another one."
"TL/DR - Alita is't monumentally life changing but it's well worth a watch. A good solid 8.5/10. Dense storytelling but still needed some more. Like trying to stuff a season of GoT into a 2 hour bladder friendly slot. I'm not usually a fan of 3d but it was worthwhile here.As others have said the animation is incredible. The action and visuals are fantastic. Characters get a much deeper treatment than is common in a lot of modern movies. Some of the negatives I have seen I will admit are fair. Most seem to center around not enough story ~ this needed to be about 2.5 -3 hrs to cover all the 4 novels the story spanned. An extended or director's cut would be incredible to really explain the character motivations stories etc. 2 hours is a very rushed timeframe for the density of story they were trying to portray. A lot of other complaints are plain nitpicky you get used to the eyes in about a minute.. there are plenty of other sights in this well crafted world to focus on. The brain? NFC what that complaint is about other than a 3-5 sec shot of a character surgically disembodied Very quick shot near the end... or perhaps that the only "human" part of Alita is her brain? no real idea what the problem is there. Others just seemed to want too much payoff wanting to have been told all about the super floating city and what all is up there."
"Best movie I� 1/2 1/2(TM)ve seen in theatres all 2019. People say it� 1/2 1/2(TM)s based on a manga (Japanese comic) and it doesn� 1/2 1/2(TM)t live up to the manga but for someone like me who went into the movie without any prior knowledge I enjoyed the movie. The action was great there were moments I wanted to tear up and nothing felt rushed or dragged. The ending was set up perfect for a sequel and I really hope that it happens. Also I feel like the �top critics�? need to be re-evaluated."
"Great fun for the whole family I have two daughters that absolutely loved it. Very relatable character for them."
"Watched Alita 2/19/2019 Dark gritty world with a young android Alita as well as the audience seeing it with fresh eyes. It was visually appealing main character was adorable at the right points and tough where appropriate. Strong female lead that did not have to announce her strength but instead showed through actions even when facing someone stronger than herself. Well worth the watch."
"So good on so many levels."
"top movie  why it is only 59%"
"Definitely had some changes from the original storyline but I was very pleased with the outcome. Made a better flowing film that did not linger too long on motorball while still giving more to come for the next film. The struggle of fitting an entire story into movie sized chunks is usually butchered but this movie pulled it off very well! And once again the critics have managed to score a great movie horribly. Sad to see this film scored in the 50% range. Should consider getting new reviewers considering audiences rated it with top numbers..... just saying."
"the most accurate anime/manga adaptation so far cant wait to see the sequel. this movie deserves it"
"Yes this movie is mostly style over substance and I don't think it's trying to fool anybody on that front. But let's be clear about two things: 1) The style is top notch. The visual effects are some of the best I've seen in a long time. We've all heard the critiques of Alita's eyes and face when the early teasers hit but the final product has been more than ironed out. Alita might be one of the most convincing CG characters I've seen since Gollum and Caesar. Salazar's performance was nuanced and the vfx artists recreated it beautifully. And 2) There is substance here! Is it Magnolia or Moonlight? No. But there is a compelling story of finding one's true self at the center of the film's plot. I normally side with most the major critics on films but in this case a majority of them are just plain wrong. Alita is a true gem amongst a sea of forgettable sci-fi action snoozers."
"Amazing movie!Good story arc great acting and motion capture. Action packed! So action packed!!! Must see on big screen. The bigger the better!"
"This was a great movie that does what I did not think could be done it makes a faithful adaptation from anime and manga to the big screen."
"Loved it. The action acting and drama was superb."
"loved the book . loved the movie. what a real strong woman lead should be"
"Really really good movie. Those so called professional critics must be eternal idiots. Alita movie is by far the best movie in the past 12 months. Much better than the marvel craps being served by disney. black panther is total xhit compare to this one."
"great movies with excellent VFX effect"
"Absolutely fantastic movie very true to the manga as well!"
"Damn good movie. Not perfect but good enough to merit a second viewing. Some folks may not appreciate the manga style depiction of the protagonist but the story more than makes up for it. Cannot wait for the sequel. Have not read the manga this movie is based on but you can bet i'll be reading it now. Bring the family and enjoy this film. Totally worth it."
"I went in with fairly low expectations and walked away amazed. This is a great movie enhanced by some of the best 3D effects I have seen in a movie. The special effects and the acting are both top notch. This is a must see movie."
"It was a pretty decent movie with good action and pacing however I was anxious to see if this film would wrap itself up with a conclusion or bait the audience for a sequel. The result? It kind of does sequel bait but even if one isn't made you can tell what would have happened anyway. I will admit that I constantly cringed during the romantic side plot and some of Salazar's acting in those scenes wasn't it for me it was very corny and not really believable. Fortunately she was pretty good throughout the rest of the movie as was Christoph Waltz and Ed Skrein two actors who I really need to see more of in their other movies. I also enjoyed seeing Mahershala Ali in this film but he was a little under-used in my opinion; he's pretty talented and I don't think he was utilised very well as an actor. The score for this movie while great at the time is very forgettable. Overall this movie was pretty good (for an anime adaptation) and I look forward to seeing more work from the cast in the future."
"Well made amazing film. As a fan of the original manga and anime I was not disappointed at all."
