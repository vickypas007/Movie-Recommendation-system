"beastly movie. well made and filled with great scenes. easily one of the funniest movies in the MCU. on second viewing i would say it is the funniest. easily one of my favorite musical scores of any MCU movie maybe my favorite. great villain. i love her and she's a beast. wish i saw more of her and about her. one comedic moments was out of place and took you out of the moment but the rest of the comedy worked. very fun and entertaining. they took this franchise in a new direction and i love it.this movie is visually exhilarating. i could probably take 200 screenshots of beautiful images. i loved everything about this movie. i considered bumping it to a 4.5 (3 viewings)SPOILERSi also wish i saw more of hulk vs the giant wolf. but i absolutely loved all of the hulk screentime in non-action situations. finally got to see him as more of a character rather than just a smasher"
"Thor ragnarok is definitely funny and is all out fun but sometimes it does forget where its story is going. This may have improved the franchise by going a different direction but it still is the weakest of them all."
"What a crap what a waste of time this movie had so much potential ... It is so much disappointing. Im not sure if i watched a Thor- Planet Hulk comic interpretation or a green Jerry Seinfeld mutation on drugs"
"jokes and slapstick should not be in a Thor based movie... period.. if you seen Thor vs Hulk and Planet Hulk animated movies you know what i talk about"
"It's barely a Thor movie it's not a Planet Hulk movie it's not a Ragnarok movie it's a lame attempt at a mishmash. Blech"
"A dumb Thor movie tries to play at being smart."
"its my favourite movie its really amazing watch more time"
"Funny and love all the planet hulk in it"
"I love all the marvel movies so I can not wait to see this"
"The best entry in the Thor series and it delivers hilarious laughs. Revived the Thor franchise"
"Ragnarok looks great entertains and is helped by a more lighthearted tone"
"Ragnarok is possibly the best Marvel film yet. I adore it. It's super entertaining and fun. Jeff Goldbloom's contributions are also side-splittingly hilarious"
"personally I absolutely LOVE this movie Thor is such an interesting character and I think hela is an awesome villain. The movie is hilarious and I laughed out loud in the theatre several times along with many others in that theatre. There was comedyand action that felt well balanced out. And I think the Thor with powers concept is really cool but I think his powers are inconsistent he falls on the floor or passes out after being shocked and other times he can beat the hulk and just beat all of the dead soldiers up. But overall I love this movie I�(TM)d give it 4.5 stars out of 5 stars."
"Best of the Marvel movies so far."
"A bit to much comedy scenes for my taste but good over all"
"Halfway through Thor: Ragnarok my wife turned to me and said "This feels a lot like a Guardians of the Galaxy movie." She was specifically referring to the film's forced and blatant humor but the similarities were everywhere. From the brighter color palette of the visuals to the infusion of classic rock one could easily mistake Ragnarok for Marvel's other space-centric franchise. And from Marvel's perspective applying their blueprint on the Guardians pictures to Thor makes perfect business sense. Despite being the strongest an Avenger the Thor movies have fared worse critically and financially compared to that lesser-known property. (At two pictures each Thor has earned more than $500 million less than Guardians of the Galaxy.)To re-align Thor Marvel turned to comedian-turned-director Taika Waititi to expand the comedy (however juvenile) and the cast of central characters (hello Hulk and Doctor Strange). Yet while "enriching" the humor Ragnarok's script unfortunately places an emphasis on character interaction over character development. Throughout the course the film our titular hero comes to lose his father his hammer and even his eye but none of that resonates with the audience because the movie's tone is constantly in flux. At one point Bruce Banner recounts to Thor how he succumbed to his inner demons and has been living as Hulk for years - now that's interesting and should be heavy but within five seconds Banner is mocking Tony Stark for how tight he wears his pants.Believe me when I read reviews that Thor: Ragnarok was "out-of-this-world" I assumed that summation was figurative but in actuality it's strictly literal - Thor's latest adventure is nothing more than a Saturday morning cartoon set in space."
"With a bit of sci-fi and a few laughs it's one of the better of these films but the dumb stuff and cheese still both rear their heads."
"This movie was incredible it is my favourite marvel movie in the line. I loved tiki watiti� 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s korg and Jeff goldblum as the grandmaster. The movie was very creative and original. I would definitely recommend this film to any superhero fan."
"'Thor: Ragnarok'? More like 'Bore: Ragnasuck'. What a stupid movie. One of the worst and most overrated superhero movies ever. Worst Marvel movie of 2017. I can't believe this garbage has a certified fresh 92% on Rotten Tomatoes. I like the storyline it told but it wasn't executed correctly... The amount of unnecessary forced jokes and slapstick comedy was ridiculous and ruined it. Taika Waititi ruined the Thor Trilogy by badly directing this franchise-killing threequel. Ragnarok is better than The Dark World but it still sucks. Ragnarok is the second worst Thor movie in the trilogy. The first Thor movie is still the best one in the trilogy and is the only good Thor movie in the franchise. The Thor sequels suck. That idiot Taika Waititi butchered the Ragnarok storyline by turning it into a stupid childish kiddie Saturday Night Live parody. Ragnarok was Thor's greatest and most epic storyline in the comics but that moron Taika Waititi fucked it up and ruined Thor's greatest darkest and most epic storyline ever. Ragnarok was this dark gritty gruesome brutal nightmarish event in which Asgard and other realms were being destroyed by the all-mighty firey demon lord Surtur thousands of Asgardians were supposed to be brutally slaughtered by Surtur all Norse gods die and an endless cycle of death and rebirth. That's how it should've been like in the movie! Some of the casting was god-awful. Tessa Thompson was horribly miscast as the Valkyrie. The Valkyrie is supposed to be portrayed as a white woman with long blonde hair. And Tessa Thompson's accent was horrible and cringey. Karl Urban was terribly miscast as Skurge the Executioner and his British accent was TERRIBLE. Skurge was a wasted villain in this movie he was nothing more than a henchman to Hela. And why did he use guns at the end? Since when does the real Executioner from the comics ever use guns? He is only supposed to use an ax as a weapon. Hela was even ruined in this movie too. Why did she have to be Thor and Loki's long lost sister? In Norse mythology and in the comics Hela (the goddess of death) is Loki's daughter. Surtur should've been the main villain instead of her. Oh and Odin's death was not emotional at all. Thor and Loki found him on Midgard then he suddenly just mysteriously disappears out of nowhere off the phase of the universe. It was never explained what happened to him in the movie. The movie didn't explain his whereabouts. It's not like Odin was ever portrayed well in the Thor movies to make the audience have an emotional connection and attachment to him. He was mostly just a grumpy old man in the previous Thor films so the emotion here is lost. His death scene was weightless not to mention a huge waste of Anthony Hopkins' talents. The film's color grading was too bright. Some of the dialogue was cheesy. The pacing was horrible and very slow. The jokes were out of control and derailed all the serious moments in the movie. Thor completely acted out of character in this movie he was an unfunny dorky comedian instead of the god of thunder. Chris Hemsworth was not Thor in this movie he was just himself in this movie. Taika Waititi totally ruined the character of Thor. The movie was weird I felt like I was watching a fan-made film. Oh and Mark Ruffalo's acting sucked like usual except in this film his acting was much worse. The Hulk was mostly just a comic relief character in this film. When the colosseum battle began that's where I started to fall asleep because the movie was so boring and extremely slow-paced. Overall Thor: Ragnarok is ultimately a disappointing overrated shallow popcorn flick that lacks depth heart substance seriousness and stakes and relies too much on stale childish humor and style over substance.Positives:. Tom Hiddleston's Loki. No Natalie Portman no Jane Foster. No Darcy. No Selvig. No intern. No stupid forced love story and romance. Almost no Midgard. Entertaining soundtrack. Some cool great action. Concept storylineNegatives:. Comedy. Pacing. Some of the visuals. Narration at the beginning. Execution. Soundtrack (Immigrant Song doesn't fit with the storyline). Anthony Hopkins being wasted. Tessa Thompson as the Valkyrie. Karl Urban as Skurge. Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk/Bruce Banner. Clancy Brown as the voice of Surtur instead of Rick Wasserman. Hela as the main villain instead of Surtur. Hela ends up being another wasted and forgettable MCU villainRating: 4.6/10"
"most fun part was loki screaming yes!! watch it on youtube and you dident miss anything"
"Exciting hilarious great characters!"
"By far the best Thor film and one of the best the MCU ever offered. Finally some character development for the Hulk and Banner. A great villain with Cate Blanchett really stepping up to the part. And please someone give Valkyrie a standalone movie. She deserves it."
"Thor Ragnarok...I thought Marvel lost their minds when they made this movie but it was I who lost their mind. It succeeds in delivering an over the top funny refreshing comic book film. It's just funny and it doesn't stop being funny."
"Though art unworthy..."
"With dazzling visual effects some great twists and turns a charismatic cast doing its best Thor 3 is the best movie of this saga and maybe the best Marvel's superheroes movie. It entertains it is touching it is clever the soundtrack is on point and the fight scenes are impressive."
"This movie is full of comedy action and the perfect music."
"Favorite marvel movie no favorite superhero movie no FAVORITE MOVIE!"
"Its pretty good for a Marvel movie tbh"
"When i first saw this movie i was disappointed because it didn't fit with the last two thor movies and it just doesn't make senses. But their are some scenes that i do like for example: the final battle with Hela.but the thing I didn't like about the movie was that really weird planets that Thor and Loki end upin. And I just didn't like the storyline."
"Watched it yesterday using boxxy software app. Changes a lot with the other Thor's movies. I didn't feel scared about Hela or de Ragnarok fight scenes aren't bad as much. Another movie from Marvel but not another movie from Thor. A Guardians of the Galaxy movie but with only humor 0 drama."
"Just so clever witty and fun. Beyind anything I expected. 10/10"
"Hemmy is super fun. Hulk is Hulk. The rest of the film was a myriad of characters all trying to prove how much annoying they could be."
"The story of the ragnarok in the comics was ruined.Humor is synonymous with this movie.There is no moment of seriousnessIt is hateful and forgettable."
"At risk of being lost in the mountain of new Marvel movies but this one has enough colorful action and clever exchanges to separate it from the pack. That being said it isn't anything better than an entertaining superhero movie"
"This movie was so hilarious and action packed that it couldn't be any better. It even has drama in it too. It truly sets up the marvel universe for the next movies to come and shows a lot of character development in Thor himself. It's beyond funny and you'll definitely be laughing the whole way through."
"I loved the movie but wish they would stay more true to the character. Making Thor scream like a little girl when he's about meet the Grand Master on Sakar. Having Thor Beg Stan not to cut his hair. It's completely out of character for Thor & a failed attempt at comedy. It's bad enough that they didn't explain why alien scavengers were able to capture & render him completely helpless with an electric net. Well maybe it wasn't electric but you get my point. Mark Ruffeo's acting performance on Sakar was weak. But Im still giving the movie 4 stars."
"Cheesy through and through. The first two were epic and moving. This was flat clearly not finished with post-production. Goldblums voice emanates clear as a whistle through an entire city with no echo or any effect whatsoever? Old overplayed rock replacing original orchestraic themes? I played Captain America civil war for my family and everyone gathered around for the epic finale. We were so enthralled we put this movie in right after and every dissipated in the first half hour. Just does not have the emotional punch that the first two have. The humor is so bad I feel like an idiot for even witnessing it."
"Thor finally comes into his own with this fantastic side story to the MCU. Amazing colourful visuals killed soundtrack memorable villains and cameos. Well worth the wait."
"Better than the first 2 Thor films combined. You can tell how much the cast enjoyed filming this by the quality of the performances. Every interaction has real chemistry. Best Thor Hulk and Loki yet. Would recommend."
"Funniest marvel movie jet!!"
"The best of the three Thor films and in my opinion one of the best Marvel movies. Great balance of humor and action. Soundtrack was really cool. The fight scene between Thor and Hulk was great just like one of their battles from the comics."
"Best comedy would watch a billion times again ( if I could )"
"Best Thor movie which isn't saying a lot. But it's funny even though tons of people died and there's very little stakes throughout. And just when things get serious- here's another joke. Great CGI and effects though. Jack Kirby would be proud. With no new Guardians movie on the horizon Thor seems poised to take the crazy wacky space story genre over."
"This movie is definitely one of my favorite Marvel movies. It's at the top with The Winter Soldier. It's what a Marvel movie needs to be. It's serious but not too serious. It's funny but not too funny. All in all it's a perfect example of a fantastic Marvel movie"
"Such a good movie well done! Great villain too!"
"One of the best Marvel movies! Enough said!"
"Wow I'm Impressed. I am surprised that this film is 80% improvised because when you watch it you wouldn't think that it is improvised. This film ticked all the boxes for me and to me it is a masterpiece. This is the funniest Marvel movie since The Guardians Of The Galaxy. This film revived the entire Thor franchise because Thor was great and Thor: The Dark World was okay. Taika Waititi change Thor's character completely and decides to make him more light hearted and comedic instead of making him a more serious character like in the previous Thor films. The plot: Thor is imprisoned on the planet Sakaar and must race against time to return to Asgard and stop Ragnar�k the destruction of his world at the hands of the powerful and ruthless villain Hela. Cate Blanchett plays the goddess of death Hela. Hela is one of the best villains in the MCU because she has a brilliant back story. This film gave us the first ever live action Hela we've ever seen before. The film also introduces the funniest MCU character since Drax Korg (played by the director of this masterpiece Taika Waititi). Whenever Korg is on screen you know that you are going to get a laugh out of his jokes or the lines that he has. The Valkyrie the sworn protector of Asgard is in it and she is played by Tessa Thompson. Tessa Thompson was very good in this movie and was a great choice to play the Valkyrie. This film even has The Incredible Hulk is in so it stars the two strongest avengers. Mark Ruffalo role as Bruce and Hulk was one of his best performances in the Marvel Universe because he even voiced the Hulk instead of Lou Ferrigno voicing him like in the other films that star The Hulk. Clancy Brown had a sneak cameo in this. He played the cause of Ragnarok Surtur one of the best Asgardian villains. Benedict Cumberbatch even can back for his second time to play the sorcerer Doctor Steven Strange who Thor had to go and see to find out when his dad was Odin ( Played by Anthony Hopkins). Jeff Goldblum is even in this film and his plays the Grandmaster.The visual effects and cinematography was brilliant in this film but my only problem with it is that when Thor Hulk and Valkyrie try to get to The Devil's Anus the visual effects and cinematography was quite bad because as there was a lot going on at once you could barely see what was going on but other than that the cinematography and the visual effects were brilliant. The action scenes in this were brilliant and were the best action sequences in a Thor film. What I didn't like about the film is that Thor is known as the god of thunder but is defeated by electricity it just makes no sense. Nonetheless Thor Ragnarok is a brilliant film and if I had to sum it up in one word it would be Masterpiece. It is extremely funny and I recommend all you Thor fans out there because this film revived the franchise so I going to give it 100%."
"a decent movie and was the best movie in the thor trilogy 81%"
"Seemed to focus more on making Thor sound arrogant and stupid while really making a Power Rangers movie instead of a Thor movie. Markedly worse than previous instances in my opinion."
"This movie crapped on the entire Marvel cmu. I walked out of the theatre. Now Spiderman: Homecoming is only the 2nd worst of the Marvel films and that's quite a feat."
"very good and only little flaws"
"Easily the best the MCU has done to date. Had to see it in the theatres twice and then watch it again on DVD. Pure movie formula gold! Action. Comedy. Epic battles. This is what a comic book movie should look like."
"Yet another marvel masterpiece"
"Great Writing: 2.0 StarsHilarious dialogue kept this movie above its plot short comings and sometimes cringe worthy lines. Added a fresh wave of comedy to a studio that takes its self to seriously. All of the serious over dramatic and boring dialog filtered out.Superb Production: 2.5 StarsCinematography special effects set design costume and music are all fabulous!"
"Humorous action packed and has a good plot."
"Thor Rarnarok is fun and a nice change of pace but all these Marvel movies are feeling a little too cute for my tastes sometimes. I enjoyed The Hulk vs. Thor fight scene though that was fun. Also a lot of the dialogue was fun but that was a given with this director. All and all good times. Solid concept solid execution."
"can't ask for a better super hero movie: visuals action humor great characters (and actors) and enough tragedy to keep everyone's motives grounded."
"Good but just a bit too much humor Mr. Waitti..."
"A fun-filled ride which subverts expectations in all the RIGHT ways.This is probably my favourite Marvel movie definitely in the top three. Thor used to be kindof bleak and serious probably to distance him from the cartoonish version in the comics but the character works tremendously in comedy and Hemsworth certainly brought his A-game to the movie set.The first time I saw the movie introduce Valkyrie I facepalmed a little thinking she would be the typical Hollywood woman stereotype of dominating men in every way then she fell off the landing pad and it was so effing funny and disarming. Valkyrie is strong and independent without disparaging men which is very rare in movies these days.It's sad that Ragnarok will likely be the last Thor movie just as the series started to hit its stride."
"The funniest film in the MCU by a long shot  and an inportent one in the story as a hole."
"Yup a fun superhero movie. THEATER worthy of my MONEY"
"The best Thor film yet by a long shot. Thor: Ragnarok feels like three movies crammed into one yet somehow it works. Creating something new within the MCU with a fresh and very different story line that will make you smile."
"Funny As Hell. Best of the 3 Thor movies. Loses some dramatic tension due to it being a comedy but fantastic Marvel movie regardless. I'll give it  - 89%"
"Another great Thor movie no regrets watching this one. You will be thoroughly entertained. Great effects use of humour and music."
"360º degree turn on a until-then falling and uninspiring trilogy Ragnarok is a colorful and campy movie that acknowledges its biggest strength and squeezes it out throughout the 2 and a half hours; its humor is spot-on even for Marvel-standards."
"What is this can we stop spoofing superheroes movies now? An extremely inconsequential instalment in the Marvel universe. And devil's anus? Really? The passable grade is largely for Mark and his actual propensity for comedic delivery."
"Disappointed is really all I can say. I went into this movie expecting the same magic as was present in the series from the '80's but was surprised that there weren't any of the original characters. I mean I didn't see a single Fraggle or Dozer in the entire movie. It's a good thing that Jim Henson is already dead because I fear seeing what they have done to his beloved series would kill him."
"HEMSWORTH IS GOOD AS THE TITLE HERO AND THE ADDITION OF TESSA THOMPSON + MARK RUFFALO MAKE FOR A GREAT ENSEMBLE . JEFF GOLDBLUM IS CAMPY FUN AND CATE BLANCHETTE IS CHEWING THROUGH SCENERY AS FAST AS SHE CAN (AND I MEAN THAT IN THE BEST WAY) DO I LOVE THOR NOW?? HATS OFF TO MARVEL + TAIKA WAITITI"
"From start to finish this movie is a blast. Being the third of three Thor movies Thor: Ragnarok was supposed to naturally progress from its predecessors but it does not. Rather it acts as a soft reboot of the trilogy by introducing a whole new cast of supporting characters but not forgetting the old one. In doing so director Taika Waititi cut off a lot of the trilogy's dead weight and brought an unexpected levity to the movie. For many people incorporating this into a dark apocalyptic plot is unforgivable and for Thor fans the personality change was jarring. However if you can get past this you will almost certainly love this movie.Unlike previous movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe Thor: Ragnarok does not dive deep into drama or integrate thought-provoking sociopolitical themes but that was not the goal of this movie. Instead it prioritized the adventures of Thor and Loki as they try to return to Asgard and stop Hela Odindottir's reign of terror. There is nothing wrong with this decision and I think that many people don't recognize this. It is okay to prioritize a movie's fun factor over the elements of richer storytelling as long as those elements are not neglected. Guess what? They're not. Three times in total throughout the movie one of three characters states the theme of the movie verbatim and Thor undergoes a very significant character arc. As well with the exception of the Grandmaster the whole supporting cast is well-developed. The point is the movie aptly emphasizes a fun and engaging experience without losing sight of what makes a film truly great.Finally I want to talk about the villain Hela Odindottir. She is not the best villain in the Marvel Cinematic Universe but she is far from the worst. Personally I like her a lot because her motivations are clear and understandable but she is also an evil force that definitely must be stopped. As of this movie's release she was one of the MCU's best alongside Zemo Vulture and Loki so I have to give Marvel credit for that.To wrap this up I think that Rotten Tomatoes' "Critics Consensus" hits the nail on the head. Thor: Ragnarok was supposed to be a "colorful cosmic adventure" that above all else was "exciting funny and fun." It accomplishes this mission and more. In the Marvel Cinematic Universe two years took place between this movie and Thor's previous major appearance which was Avengers: Age of Ultron. So I could easily accept that Thor's personality may have changed. Also I think that the movie handled the apocalyptic plot with its comedy very well so I was not bothered by this either. As a result Thor: Ragnarok is definitely my favorite superhero movie and as a huge fan of the superhero genre it is my favorite movie of all time."
"Unexpectedly brilliant Taika Waititi gives new impetus to the Thor franchise that appeared stalled and out of ideas after Dark World. A colourful kaleidoscope of humour action and classic villainy."
"Agradable pelicula aunque hay momentos de exceso de chiste pero lo dem�s es muy entretenido"
"for me the movie is unfortunate has some very important events and had the potential to be the darkest and tragic of the entire marvel universe and ended up being the most childish of all and a joke that can not be taken seriously the only good thing about the movie It was the hela villain that it was time to see a powerful supervillain in this universe."
"Creative funny and engaging. These words just about sum it up. Cate Blanchett in the role of Hela works brilliantly and leaves the audience dreading what happens next. Once again the role of Thor is played expertly by Chris Hemsworth and he puts an assertive and believable performance as the role of the great norse god. Overall I think that it is flippin brilliant"
"Best marvel movie ever!"
"Much worst than expected especially from the hype that mislead me to watch this movie. Disney needs a new formula.."
"Chris Hemsworth reprises the role that put him on the map and he embraces Thor with a reckless abandon. This is the most Thor movie to date deciding to really explore what it means to be a god while spewing one-liners at a furious pace. There is also a levity when considering what Ragnarok means in the Nordic mythology which is the end of days. So we anticipate some kind of Armageddon will befall the citizens of Asguard.We find Thor is imprisoned on the planet Sakaar run by a flamboyant tyrant in a role destined for eccentric Jeff Goldblum. Here he is forced to participate in gladiatorial games against his own friend The Hulk. This leads to incredible battle sequences and satisfies any desire you had to see these two immensely powerful beings face off. We are treated to Thor tapping into his own potential he was unaware of until the situation dictates it. The special effects for these sequences are beautiful and slow motion is actually used appropriately adding the intended dramatic effect.The death of Thor's father looms largely over his decisions and how he conducts his life. This is a more grounded movie despite the colorful trappings and almost acid dream designs of this world. Thor is deeply affected by visions of his father and the void which has been left behind. Adding insult to injury he has lost his hammer robbing him of some of his power. His father tries to teach Thor his hammer is not the true source of his power but something deep inside himself. I actually felt Thor doubting himself in this film when he normally feels so confident.Thor plays fast and loose with the prophecy but you do feel the weight of what will happen to his world. This film knows when to turn off the switch on the comedy and reach out to touch your heart. The scenes with Thor's father are heartwarming and show there is perhaps another side to this seemingly perfect Nordic god. The humor comes more from the situations which leads to genuinely funny moments but the one-liners are fast and furious.Thor is never allowed to wallow in the sadder moments and is brought back to being a very humorous take which would be difficult considering the Armageddon. Largely this movie rests on Chris Hemsworth's ability to use his affable charm but it never wears thin as they stay away from some of the lectures present in the other iterations. The director wisely does not play a joke past its expiration date moving on after the punchline is delivered. I often find some of the Marvel movies tiresome with their attempts at humor but it feels a lot more natural here. He never really sinks to woe is me blues but continues to infuse the movie with an upbeat charm.Loki is always delightful as the trickster looking to throw a wrench into the plans. He has earned the throne but is cast in disarray when a shape-shifting Hela arrives played by Cate Blanchett. Her villain works as a delightfully over the top caricature but also a surprising connection to Thor's past. Largely this film is about figuring out your past so you can plan for the future. This theme constantly repeats throughout the movie and unlocking your potential by tapping into your past.Redemption is another theme for characters you may have found beyond reinventing themselves. However you can never count out these characters with being allowed to grow. Sometimes a superhero movie feels like everything will return to normal and the characters do not change. This feels different and the characters actually believably grow. There is a sense of finality to the crucial decisions and some heartbreaking images of Thor accepting his limitations.Taika Waititi imbues this movie with his comedic sensibilities and we are all the better for it enjoying impeccable timing. He draws out the best performance from Hemsworth to date and also allows the movie to have a beating heart. We get the best version of the character by forcing him in the most dire of circumstances . The real treat is seeing how Hulk and Thor interact as long-time friends with their witty banter being the highlight of the film. This is the movie you would introduce to someone unfamiliar with the character. We feel this time for his plight and are affected by the scars he incurs through the events of this film. Sure the end may be a foregone conclusion but the writing smartly takes us on a surprising journey towards that end. There are times where the journey can be just as satisfying and this is no different."
"Enjoyable romp. Love the use of synthwave music. Stunning visuals. Not a huge fan of a joke tagging every scene."
"The best comedy of the Marvel Universe. I was not looking for that :("
"One of the best marvel movies ever been made"
"This is without a doubt the worst Thor movie ever. Loki and Thor were extremely out of character. Why is Thor acting like Starlord? Why does the script feel like a bad knock off of Guardians of the Galaxy? Why were the Warriors 3 treated like Red Shirts? Where was Sif? Why did you just WASTE Odin?! What was the point of robbing Hulk of his own movie and taking one of the best Hulk comics (Planet Hulk) and just lazily slapping it in here? Why is it you kept doing so many dramatic things but NOT CALLING ATTENTION TO THE DRAMATIC THINGS AND CRACKING JOKES INSTEAD?! Can the characters show human emotion for more than 2 seconds?! God at least Infinity War had the decency to ignore your horrible interpretations of Thor and Loki�(TM)s characters and let them actually act like interesting characters capable of emotions instead of hurrdurr muh FUNNLY JOKES"
"So far this is my favorite Marvel movie. Good humor a lot of action and interesting storyline makes it easy to watch and really enjoy the movie."
"Very enjoyable good action and great villain.3 or 4 really hard laughs. 90%"
"what can you say its the end"
"Thor ragnorok is a fun movie and a funny movie"
"This was a fun movie but thats all I can say the villan in it was just a little flat and while I normally love the hulk in this movie he was lacking something. Saying that I enjoyed it."
"The best Marvel movie. It's directed by Waititi so of course it is."
"This movie is beautiful funny and exciting. It feels very much like nurse mythology with these awesome characters like Surtur and the Fenris Wolf. And Hela as the main villain. All the actors does a great job. The reason the movie "only" gets a 8/10 for me is because of the planet Sakaar. I did not really like those parts of the movie too much. A bit too over the top and silly except the arena fight. But I'm overall very satisfied with this ending to the trilogy directed by Taika Waititi."
"I had high hopes for this movie but it was full of unnecessary jokes with very poor story. This is like a parody movie. It was a waste of time and money for me. Its not interesting and doesn't deserve all the hype. The only scene I liked was when thor fought with hulk.Thor became a comedian everybody is a comedian. You can't take anything serious. Hela is not even an interesting villain how powers are not well explained. Marvel can do better."
"The third entry in the Thor series following the lackluster response to 2013's 'The Dark World' comes hot on the trail of Marvel's otherGuardians 2 and Spiderman Homecoming. And you have no idea how happy it makes me to type out that this blows those two movies completely out of the water isunlike anything that Marvel Studios has done before.This CHAOTIC Sci-Fi action comedy should be a dark brooding tale; Norse mythology Ragnarok is the Apocalypse and destruction of all mankind.INSTEAD Director Taika Watiti has managed to capture not only the panic of said pending events with Thor being at the helm of trying to make sure this does not happen but also forged a complete epic of both space and mythology that will keep you laughing literally from the first minute until the end credits.I literally do not know how to desrcibe this other than a perfect blend of several different genres mixed together so well that at times you forget you're watching a Thor/Marvel movie.Hemsworth steals the show here with an emsemble of new and old characters behind him all of whom get their time to shine - bringing heart charm and most of all laughs CONSISTENTLY through the two hours.This shift in the storytelling of Thor has made him relevant again and quite frankly is poised to usher in a new type of Marvel movie making - one where the audience can laugh hysterically together throughout while applauding great storytelling.A Chaotic sci-fi adventure that is both heartfelt and funny Thor : Ragnarok has done the impossible.Grade : A"
"I mean it's not going to go down in history as a great movie or anything. It's not a great movie. But it's funny and entertaining and light and the cinematography is pretty. Worth a chill Saturday watch for sure."
"I thought the previous Thors sucked. But this one was not that dumb. Lots of funny bits with all the actors playing it for jokes. The films laughs at itself and beats Black Panther for it. Also glad of the ending!"
"Best marvel movie to date."
"A Marvel Movie that has everything it needs to be great yet somehow falls stale. Blu-ray will likey take you where you want to be. 4K if you have it."
"best thor movie yet deserves the best rating funny action packed and very on point movie"
"This movie was so bad it hurt."
"heard about it on a podcast. the hosts were all super surprised at how good it was. i have seen the other two but wasn't inclined to go see this one. watched it after listening to the podcast and WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED. this movie is hilarious had me in stitches throughout the film. fresh witty engaging and definitely worth a second watch."
"Thor: Ragnarok definitely takes The MCU to a whole new level. It's funny charming and is definitely a step-up from the previous Thor films"
"This is one of my top 5 movies for sure!!!"
"Visually and tonally dissonant with the previous entries. Casually offs all but two or three of the original side characters. The biggest fail however is the horrible over usage of bathos which left Thor nothing more than a comedic figure. Nice graphics though."
"Thor Ragnarok is a film that tries too hard to be something it shouldn't be funny. It is a frustrating overrated film that sets a bad tone given that infinity war is set straight after. It goes from "funny" to dark sinister and serious."
