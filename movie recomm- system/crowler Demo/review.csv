"Aquaman has to rely on its visual wonder as the script is rather rough-shod with some of the worst dialogue I can remember from these capes and tights exercises"
"Too much going on; too little of it matters."
"Aquaman's script is plodding and lacking the emotional weight or character development it needs to draw the viewer in"
"Released fifteen years ago this flick would have been a good enough romp to pass the time. Now however with the advent of so many incredible superhero ventures Aquaman just feels stagnant."
"CGI action fans will be awestruck by the special effects which dominate Aquaman a must-see in 3-D."
"Any excitement audiences expected from director James Wan who has helped reinvigorate the horror genre with The Conjuring series will wonder if perhaps his success is limited to blood baths and jump scares."
"There are no answers because none are deemed necessary."
"I won't front like I didn't enjoy some elements of the film but as a whole? It felt like I was watching a film based on what worked in a number of superhero flicks over the last few years."
"It's certainly more entertaining and competent than most of the previous DCEU films but that makes its silly missteps and bloated plot all the more frustrating."
"Take one clich� from every comic book movie of the past decade put them in a blender then throw that blender into the ocean. Boom. You've got yourself an Aquaman movie."
"Aquaman is far too long constantly undercutting its charm in service to derivative action sequences that lose all appeal by the third act."
"The periodic bursts of creativity and weirdness can't fully hide the fact that this superhero epic doesn't offer anything new. It's mostly fun but could have been way better."
"While its stunning visuals and underwater combat make it a vast improvement over many of the other DCEU films an overcrowded story and campy dialogue make it far more exhausting than exciting."
"With big battles and complex lore it clearly wants to be an underwater Lord of the Rings but instead ends up closer to Phantom Menace territory with some tonally incoherent splashes of Fast and Furious."
"[Aquaman] wasn't for me but I admire a lot about this movie."
"Aquaman is simply too over-stuffed and over-long."
"With the world the way it's going it's not surprising people would rather watch a buffed guy swim with dolphins. But with so many resources spent on it this is one underwater adventure that dries out fast."
"There were some cringe-worthy acting moments in this movie...that's due to the script more so than the actors themselves."
"It's the world of Exposition."
"This movie is a theme park ride... while it's fun it has really no big emotional impact."
"This movie is a theme park ride... while it's fun it has really no big emotional impact."
"Ultimately like much of the DCEU Aquaman just can't make things work. While there's a definite sense of humor behind the film it doesn't take things far enough."
"Aquaman is not really a bad movie by DC's standards but it is the weirdest thing they've made in recent years by a country mile - and not always in a good way."
"Often divertingly colorful and busy to a fault Aquaman seems to dare us to mock the world of comics' most risible superhero."
"It's not the greatest superhero film but it's not the worst and everything it has to offer has been done better."
"All in all it's not great but it's not terrible. Better than Thor 2 I will say that but I feel like this is one of those movies I'll forget the plot of."
"It's good that Aquaman is so action packed and full of visual distractions that it doesn't leave you any time to reflect because once you stop to pause the plot really sinks."
"If Aquaman has anything going for it it's the fact that it fully embraces just how ridiculous it is."
"Aquaman is super fun when it embraces its silliness-there's an octopus that plays the drums! There's an army of cranky crab-men!-but by the end it just feels bloated and squishy."
"The DC Comics aesthetic has never been more accurately portrayed on screen so it has that going for it. Narratively though it's still kind of a mess. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"There are some impressive battle sequences but a few too many moments of poor CGI making it feel like you are watching a cartoon or someone playing a video game at times."
"Momoa might nail the everyman end of the spectrum with copious beer guzzling and manly hair flipping but he doesn't invest this dude with much regal leadership potential."
"Is there anything hugely wrong with Aquaman? Not really. Is this a missed opportunity? Yes."
"There are so many unnecessary CGI blowups cluttering the movie that Mera's chemistry with Arthur doesn't get the oxygen it needs to ignite the love affair Aquaman wants us to believe in."
"The underwater action-adventure picks the most over-the-top elements of James Wan's directorial style and mixes it with cartoonish CGI and 80s comic-book madness for a laughably bad end result."
"People will be very cross that I don't get what was trying to be done or that I didn't catch the comic references - but you know what? Get in the sea."
"Two and a half hours literally submerged in a giant fish tank where except for common sense everything floats. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"It could have been worse but maybe it could also have been good?"
"Director James Wan (Insidious The Conjuring Saw) has brought a very particular vision to the project and it's undoubtedly a brazenly idiosyncratic take on a superhero movie."
"Even graced with the charming company of Momoa and Nicole Kidman who is having a blast playing his high-kicking otherworldly mother the timing and tone of this movie is consistently off."
"However beyond the exuberant visual display to give life to the civilization of Atlantis and to develop the spectacular underwater battles [James Wan's] contribution in Aquaman is disappointing. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Its infrequent shots of fun aren't worth the headache."
"I do not have a single reason to recommend Aquaman or its Atlantic or oceanic din despite its good intentions to denounce the seas' ecological disorder [caused by] human beings. [Full review in Spanish]"
"This time the origin story is under the sea in a fight for dynasty but Aquaman is unable to disembark from the kitsch weight that is characteristically DC. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"It has very little to call its own and in its quest to join the greatest hits it ends up imitating some good hits without creating anything original. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"With ups and downs between the fantastic and the absurd Aquaman is plainly a fish out of water. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"I didn't hate Aquaman though at close to two-and-a-half hours it was beginning to outstay its welcome when the credits finally rolled."
"Whatever the case Aquaman falls into an uncomfortable try-hard dead zone that leaves it in better shape than say Batman v. Superman or Suicide Squad but just shy of the gleefully anarchic predecessors... like Jupiter Ascending."
"Sadly it's a crazy amalgam of subpar storytelling non-stop action and constantly swirling camera work. Motion sickness ahoy!"
"Aquaman appears to have everything except rhythm or a clear vision. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"But that did not justify a film that does not go either up or down but floats desperately in a languid ocean so shallow that floating in it is clearly useless unnecessary a vile waste of energy. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"But oh those action sequences: this is what the Tron sequel should have looked and sounded like."
"Aquaman is an adventure without an anchoring character or idea and suffers from the plodding stolidness of its lead actors."
"The film isn't totally unenjoyable but it isn't particularly coherent either."
"Take away Momoa's steady presence and you're looking at an overstuffed mess that provides entertainment purely in an OMG-this-is-a-disaster kind of way."
"The fix is easy: Mo Momoa Fewer Problems."
"Director James Wan keeps things moving but seems a little out of his depth when fishing for laughs."
"The film is indeed a little stronger in story and character than some of its predecessors in the DCEU have been but it still has a long list of problems all its own to contend with."
"There is the occasional cool visual and clever world-building detail like jellyfish couture and eye-popping underwater physics but Aquaman never fully commits to its lunacy."
"naturally overlong overblown and sopping wet with CG effects."
"It seems director James Wan had one overarching goal in making Aquaman.His prime directive? Crush the audience into submission."
"If the series is going to fully recover from Zack Snyder's early assault it will have to better marry brains with brawn resisting the false choice of Wan's salty blow out."
"If there was one film to sum up the hit-and-mostly-miss nature of the DCEU it's Aquaman."
"Sure it's memorable but it's far too unwieldy to be effective."
"One just has to throw up one's fins and give in to the ridiculousness."
"Love Momoa -- but two hours and twenty-three minutes is plenty of time to contemplate why Warners cannot manage the Marvel touch."
"Had this movie arrived as recently as two years ago it might have been heralded as a higher-end superhero movie. Things have changed however in both the DCEU and the MCU."
"Watching this movie is like spending two hours and 27 minutes staring at a gigantic aquarium full of digital sea creatures and actors on wires pretending to swim."
"James Wan has thrown everything he can think of on the screen but the best special effect in this extravaganza is Jason Momoa's hair."
"A superhero movie with the scope of an epic but the spirit of a mischievous boy Aquaman is a goofy uneven adventure that proudly sticks to its loopy vision even if it doesn't quite work."
"The wow factor is gone - it's a bubbly undersea yawn."
"For all its sporadic wackiness and wonder on balance Aquaman still comes out a bore. But they've given it a heroic shake."
"Like with so many movies tasked with introducing unseen worlds and great reams of brand-new mythology Wan's contribution to the DCEU offers a busy overpowering deluge of information even if he conjures some stunning operatic imagery along the way."
"You lift Dude Bro? Cuz this ship is sinking..."
"The special-effects (especially in the all-important underwater environment) never quite pack the wow-factor expected from a massive $225 million production."
"The majority of the time the action set pieces seem quite arbitrary... This saddles the overlong film with a ponderous grinding feel one driven by a sense of obligation more than the glee of inspiration."
"Through it all Jason Momoa... tosses off coyly bluff one-liners with understated humor that goes to waste in this bloated and sludgy movie."
"Aquaman is such an eyeball-scald and an eardrum-shiv it makes me long for the relative excellence of Justice League."
"None of it makes a ripple of sense even when blown up to IMAX 3D size."
"The screenplay must have had the line suddenly they are interrupted by an explosion copied and pasted randomly several times throughout."
"[James Wan's] conjured an intriguing world but populated that world with dramatic cotton candy and silly characters including a hero who's unsure if he wants to make us laugh or feel - and winds up doing neither."
"In a better world Aquaman would excel at delivering an ecological message to the masses. But all the fish in the sea can't salvage a movie that refuses to go more than surface deep."
"It is far too silly to be taken seriously and far too plodding to work as some kind of oddball oddity. It never sinks to the depths (sorry) of a complete misfire... but it just never clicks."
"At times though it's ludicrous even for kids' stuff and its undersea make-believe means we face an even heavier battering from CGI than comic-book movies usually deliver."
"This is a competent enough origin story but its oddball nature means that it's unintentionally hilarious at times."
"The latest movie from the DC Universe is an embarrassing shamble that is highlighted by clunky dialogue characters who constantly shout their dialogue and hackneyed CGI special effects that look as if interns created them."
"The bright spots (Momoa that octopus) can be difficult to really relish amid the oceans of exposition and a typically pulverizing overelaborate screenplay."
"When it's not tediously predictable in its clich�s its complete lack of narrative or thematic daring and its colorless meathead hero it's a mess of incoherent action and noisy psychedelic chaos."
"While Momoa is just fine as the titular Aquaman [the] screenplay features far too little humor and far too much origin story - by the time Orm's visiting those remaining undersea realms they feel like jammed in afterthoughts."
"It's such a mess not even a fine performance by Jason Momoa as the shirtless and trident wielding good-ol'-superhero can rescue it from the bottom of the sea."
"It's just two and a half years of - sorry two and a half hours - of oceanic screen savers and hair that won't stop undulating so we know when we're underwater."
"Not even an up-for-anything Jason Momoa can save Aquaman from being a joke. Still the fun is a relief after all the recent DCEU superhero gloom. Any fish epic that finds time to show us an octopus playing bongos gets a pass in our book."
"There's plenty of visual invention on display but the eye can't totally silence a question from the mind: How much underwater spectacle does an Aquaman movie need before we start to drown in it?"
"Quite possibly the worst comic book movie ever made..."
"The underwater world is CGI at its most smothering-your eyes cry out for air for tangibility. Everything is weightless and yet oppressive like a sheet tangled around a drowning human body."
"Jason Momoa is perfectly cast as the DC action hero but the movie is not as good as he is. Too long too many repetitive fight scenes and just a general dragginess to the whole thing."
"James Wan's Aquaman has way too much going on. It's all three Lord of the Rings underwater with a grand finale giant fish war that's like the largest tureen of bouillabaisse ever cooked."
"Another disappointing entry in the DC Comics cinematic universe."
"It's wildly uneven tonally all over the map and clogs the screen with special effects that range from pretty great to pretty bad. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence Profanity etc. - also Available)"
"It doesn't suck but only if you're willing to sit through two hours of waterlogged world-building before the movie finally takes off."
"It left me weary and water-logged. Blub-blub."
"Generating some modest thrills with minimal genuine suspense the film dives deep visually while emotionally remaining on the surface."
"Only Julie Andrews voicing a sea monster a CGI octopus playing eight drums at the same time and Roy Orbison's "She's a Mystery to Me" which backs a video-like tribute to Curry's blooming love interest (Amber Heard) gurgle up anything memorable."
"Jason Momoa's surf-bro superhero is a welcome addition to a ponderous genre but his movie as a whole is waterlogged."
"Take a dehumidifier to Aquaman and after all the water evaporates what's left is a garden-variety superhero movie."
"As the equivalent of a Jason Momoa pinup calendar Aquaman rates four stars. As a superhero film this soggy enterprise merits decidedly less."
"Aquaman mostly ignores establishing let alone developing or evolving its eponymous superhero in any meaningful way."
"Like the story the lines the performances and the design Aquaman is part camp part kitsch but all crap."
"This is a let-down: a laborious slow-moving and dripping wet film barnacle-encrusted with solemnity and with a ripply-underwater production design that looks like a giant version of the kitschy items that you put in fish-tanks."
"When you start worrying in a superhero universe about the mechanics of how it works it means that something isn't clicking."
"An overstuffed B picture which stretches its fun too thin."
"At times the plot feels like the 12 Labors of Hercules with a couple of extra labors thrown in just for the heck of it."
"Even Arthur seems to know this is all 'find the maguffin and save the world' but the film can't have that much fun with it. The screenwriters have to play through the typical save the world/fulfill your destiny plot with predictable twists."
"Halfway through the waterlogged kookiness that is Aquaman I half expected the title character to announce that he lived in a pineapple under the sea."
"There aren't enough drumming octopi to make this movie memorable an observation I thought I'd never have to make."
"It was only about 20 minutes into Aquaman that I heard the unmistakable sound of a movie taking on water... Titanic didn't go down this fast."
"Momoa while amiable is like a handsome stuntman. He and Heard cannot carry the film. Derivative action. Creatures from menu at Red Lobster."
"DC Comics' oceanic superhero gets his own movie but star Jason Momoa isn't enough of a screen presence to carry the weight."
"All in all it amounts to the most campy DC outing since Joel Schumacher helmed a couple of Batman movies in the '90s. That's not a recommendation."
"Aquaman as directed by James Wan and reconceived by Warners executives chasing after Marvel's jackpot is all about copycat desperation -- and shrillness."
"Overall it's not top-notch quality but a goofy film with a goofy protagonist a visually stunning world and fun action sequences."
"I like Aquaman. I'm not saying it's a great movie or that it's the savior of the DC cinematic universe but it is a lot of fun."
"See it on the big screen for a fun beautiful underwater ride. Just don't expect too much in terms of story and acting."
"A visual and audio symphony by James Wan which takes VFX storytelling - and the DCEU - to a whole new level. This movie has to be seen to be believed!"
"Aquaman gives Warner Bros. another base hit for the DCEU but it might have been better served by making it a Mera-centric film with Aquaman as a supporting player."
"Aquaman may be the movie Arthur Curry's alter-ego deserves an epic spectacle of ludicrous joy that's as dreadfully terrible as it is thrilling."
"Bold ambitious visually stunning and wonderfully unique James Wan's Aquaman is one of the best comic book films of the year."
"A superhero origin story with an aquatic Avatar Star Wars war and Indiana Jones treasure-hunt adventure rolled into one. It makes a seaworthy splash amidst all the superhero fares. A swimmingly rollicking action-packed fantasy adventure."
"a serviceable entry that is worth dipping one's toes back into the DC cinematic waters"
"Aquaman is goofy and messy and sprawling hyperactive and jokey ... but it isn't bleak. It is unabashedly itself and by not taking itself so seriously it allows room for some actual fun."
"It's a step in the right direction [for Warner Bros. and the DC Extended Universe.] There's just a few kinks to be worked out before the inevitable sequel."
"It's predictable yet fun; it's a worthy hero origin but being that it's this good for a hero so heavily chided for so long it feels like even more of an accomplishment."
"Superhero stories aren't just about fighting but the examination of self. When Aquaman remembers this it's a sight to behold."
""Aquaman the film isn't as deep as the ocean but Aquaman the man is just as captivating.""
"It avoids being sheepish about its more preposterous concepts instead revelling in its comic book goofiness for a rollicking B movie adventure."
"Aquaman swims more often than it sinks buoyed by stunning visuals and an inherently compelling world that should be further developed beyond this origin film."
"Momoa is a triumph in this joyously spectacular tale of myth and modernity; its hero so endearing it's easy to ignore the clunkiness of the dialogue and a villain treading water until next time. The salt water gets everywhere I even found some in my eye."
"The film's hyperkinetic nature makes it impossible to be less than entertained. But because Aquaman is always go go go there's not much room for character development."
"Either the best bad movie or the worst good movie of 2018."
"Aquaman is a visually entertaining superhero film that is sure to entertain the masses despite its flaws."
"It's definitely worth the watch and I do think that the best way to experience this movie would be on the biggest screen possible. I don't think that 3D would be necessary either."
"With the game cast a charismatic lead performance by Jason Mamoa the electrifying visuals and the infectiously fun tone Aquaman is a cinematic wave you will want to catch."
"Sitting through Aquaman I had that feeling that I was watching a bad movie but by the time the end credits rolled I had to accept the fact that I was consistently entertained and never bored by James Wan's crazy blockbuster."
"A colorfully over-the-top comic book adventure that overcomes tonal stumbles and some iffy CG with pure charisma and fun."
"Whilst Aquaman is far from perfect it still delivers an entertaining vibrant ride and Momoa shows us what DC really stands for - Damn Cool."
"While Wonder Woman reveled in the intimacy of Themyscira Aquaman and director James Wan paints the largest picture possible."
"We have another movie about a biracial hero coming to terms with his place in the world a superhero film that enthusiastically embraces its more ludicrous tropes and a sprawling epic that makes the movies of the DCEU worth watching again."
"Aquaman - for the DC Universe - is better than expected. But if you understand the cinematic inconsistencies within the franchise then you know that's not a complement."
"Aquaman is a new terrific entry in the belt of DC a visual masterpiece that is utterly riveting throughout."
"Royalty is merely dignified status. Heroes are revered legends. Cue the "why not both" gif and you've got Aquaman."
"To use a cliche - because this movie loves them - it's just crazy enough to work."
"It brings across that feeling of how deep dark and mysterious the sea is."
"There was no theme ultimately but the music did help move the movie along..."
"With fun nonstop action Wan's stylistic direction and strong charismatic performances (especially by Momoa) "Aquaman" brilliantly solidifies that the DCEU is here to stay."
"There are a lot of structural problems in this movie some things that are a little too long...but it's also a very fun movie to watch and it exceeded all of my expectations."
"It's a fun movie a little long but the pacing of the action is actually pretty good..."
"[Jason Momoa] makes the movie really fun to watch."
"Bloated and overcooked yes those two things are possible the film somehow succeeds in its own zany weird way. Aquaman should be seen on the biggest screen possible with the least pretentiousness given."
"Because it is entertaining "Aquaman" can rest comfortably as the second best film in the DCEU."
"Director James Wan is not concerned with shoehorning his film into the greater DCEU which gives him the freedom to make a film that rolls Aquaman's origin story and an exciting plot into a movie that surpasses most of the studio's other efforts."
"Hunky self-deprecating Jason Momoa is more of an Aqua Dude buoyed by a riotous deluge of dazzling visuals that refresh the DC universe."
"While Aquaman is one of the better DC films it is still fairly uneven. It gives us a glimpse at a whole new mythos and makes the world of Atlantis feel ancient creating a fantasy story that offers something different for DC fans"
"It's all eye candy for the viewer. The production designers have outdone themselves."
"It had a few stumbles but as a whole it is an awesome action-packed adventure."
"...it's a more memorable movie than most of the lesser Marvel films and thus DC takes another step toward righting the ship."
"I can recommend Aquaman as a fun couple of hours in the theatre. It isn't going to re-write cinema or anything but I do think it keeps DC in the running for being able to produce an enjoyable movie that entertains fans and casual watchers alike."
"Jason Momoa is an excellent Aquaman and the world of Atlantis looks like something out of "Avatar." But there are some things that feel too cartoonish some jokes don't quite land and the film continues to make some mistakes of past DC entries."
"The film is a treat to behold whenever it dives into the ocean as Wan embraces the absurdity at every turn wearing the inherent goofiness as a badge of honour."
"For some it might be an acquired taste but it succeeds by pairing simplistic narrative ambitions with an authentically wild visual experience."
"Aquaman is so exquisitely tailored to and fitted around the outsized personality and impressive form of Jason Momoa that it's almost impossible to distinguish star from vehicle from character."
"A movie where budding romance rising palace intrigue and swash-buckling adventure take a back seat to the quiet glee of watching a team of gifted visual effects artists recreate the aesthetic of a Lisa Frank trapper keeper on a giant IMAX screen."
"Momoa was terrific in the role and even though it's peculiar that the DCEU is doing things in reverse we've finally arrived at his time to shine in a solo film."
"One of the most wildly imaginative and purely fun blockbusters of the year."
"Wan manages to marry Arthurian fantasy and swashbuckling adventure with camp in Aquaman a film that feels a little like a miracle in Warner Bros.' catalogue of superhero movies"
"Aquaman is the increasingly rare superhero movie that's also a star vehicle as well as being one hell of a triumph for its director."
"Aquaman is a hit."
"I think the movie is fun. For some reason some people can't accept it...when can "fun" not be an acceptable way to describe a movie?"
"Check your brain at the door and you should mostly enjoy its 143 minutes."
"This movie is really entertaining -- a lot of fun! But it's also "a lot" period."
"It's still style over substance a lot of the time but that style bears a real love for the source material and that's what should be at the heart of every superhero film. Well that and Jason Momoa's abs."
"It swims more than it sinks."
"James Wan has created something that feels fresh and new in a genre that is beginning to feel very tired and formulaic."
"Aquaman promises to bring hope to the DC universe. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Like much of the movie it doesn't really make sense but you just go with the flow and enjoy the ride."
"Aquaman is filled with incredible sequences. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Aquaman works as well as it does because director James Wan gives us a story in which we find ourselves wanting to tag along for the fun."
"Wan weaves comedy sci-fi high fantasy and action into something that constantly surprises. Jam-packed with brilliant action spectacular visuals and likable characters Aquaman is never afraid to have fun which makes it a bright spark in 2018."
"At times spectacularly stupid at other times just plain spectacular Aquaman is Thor by way of the Fast and the Furious franchise."
"Go on dive in."
"[Momoa] clearly knows he cannot take the subject matter too seriously and there is always that wink smirk and devil-may-care attitude that makes him rather charming."
"Its unapologetic ridiculousness is exactly why it's so delightful bucking so many of the rules set for the genre in the last decade."
"I'm not saying Aquaman is good. But it is extremely watchable totally insane good time."
"This really is the quintessential 21st century popcorn movie. Almost every shot has CGI surrounding the actors it has a diverse cast and there's enough action in it that you'll never feel bored."
"[James] Wan definitely took the opportunity to lean into the campiness and Momoa's innate sense of humor and that's not necessarily a bad thing."
"While DCEU heroes like Henry Cavill's Superman and Ben Affleck's Batman were unbearably solemn it is easy to see that Momoa is having a blast in the lead role."
"It's certainly fun to watch and I spent most of it giggling with glee and/or dismay at how crazy it all was. But it also feels like wasted potential."
"Aquaman is an ambitious film but one that isn't afraid of being campy while being committed as an action-packed underwater adventure."
"There's a knowing silliness to Aquaman that helps gloss over its sometimes-shaky CG and over-complicated mythology and a willingness to go for broke that keeps us guessing about what we'll witness next."
"A star turn for Momoa who leads the ridiculousness of this anarchic campy superhero outing with serious energy and charm. Another promising move for the DCEU."
"I would watch Arthur Curry splash around throwing punches twenty times rather than return to a color-drained and depressing cityscape where the hero is sad and mad."
"Playing like a modern-day parody of '80s fantasy films like Clash of the Titans Aquaman embraces the camp the zany and the weird."
"But the real star of Aquaman is its director. [Full review in Spanish]"
"A fascinating and admirable journey that includes almost every element of the superhero genre you can think of. - [Full review in Spanish]"
"The costuming is on point and the visuals of the film are amazing. Atlantis in particular feels like an underwater Pandora and is a feast for the eyes. Where the wheels start falling off is continuity scriptwriting and use of characters."
"Not perfect and a little long but fun chaotic an full of action humor adventure and a carisma-filled cast that enjoys itself as much as it wants the audience to enjoy it [Full review in Spanish]"
"The director knows what he has in hand and makes the most of it. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Aquaman is an underwater spectacle that wholeheartedly embraces its comic book roots from the costumes to the cheesiness."
"... from beginning to end Aquaman is big dumb fun. It doesn't dare take itself seriously and it's a better movie for it."
"Aquaman is a goofy fun time if you don't think too hard."
"It might suffer from a patchwork script a lack of sincere characterization and tonal shifts that are more chaotic than any shark-on-whale battle but damn if it doesn't look pretty."
"Aquaman offers two and a quarter hours of pure and simple escape. [Full review in Spanish]"
"James Wan delivers an entertaining adventure film full of incredible visuals exciting action and nifty camera work. Aquaman is a winner! [Full review in Spanish]"
"Aquaman is a flawed but thoroughly entertaining adventure movie and certainly one of the strongest instalments so far in the inconsistent Worlds of DC franchise."
"Momoa is a hugely talented comic actor and he brings a playfulness and enthusiasm to this film which keeps it bubbling along despite - or even as a response to - the tiredness and predictability of the plotting."
"Not all comic book characters have unsolvable mommy issues and sometimes embracing the cheese is a relief."
"Director James Wan manages to make the film be unlike anything else in the genre. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Aquaman's faults are very marked but its virtues are impressive and manages to create an entertaining experience. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Aquaman dares to be its own beast. And with a charismatic hero at its center to bridge the divide DC remembers playfulness can actually be a boon."
"It's just H2-OK."
"Aquaman is a well blended smoothie of 1980s fare which often works to its advantage but sometimes results in clumsy and clunky moments."
"Despite the nagging flaw that is Aquaman's hyper-extended plot the movie delivers in its action sequences and its bright visuals."
"It's equal parts Game of Thrones and Indiana Jones; like Black Panther told from Killmonger's perspective. It isn't as polished as Wonder Woman but neither is it as putrid as Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice."
"When you're riding a damn shark into war and there's an octopus playing drums and also Nicole Kidman is there? I wouldn't say no."
"Aquaman is a hard concept to buy into but when this much thought and care has gone into its construction it's easy to get caught up in the wonderment of it all without asking too many questions."
"It's neither the worst nor the best superhero film of the year but it feels small compared to efforts like 'Infinity War' or 'Spider-verse'. [Full review in Spanish]"
"The real appeal of Aquaman comes down to director James Wan who goes full bore with all the Silver Age pulp the source material has to offer."
"A fantastic display of Big Trident Energy that's more than happy to attempt beating you into submission."
"What ultimately holds it together is that this film is self-aware about its silliness to the point that it is often sublime."
"It's big and splashy a visual feast with real stakes but also with an earnestness it wears proudly on its sleeve."
"It may not be coherent but as far as messes go Aquaman is certainly one of Hollywood's more watchable ones."
"It's just a fun unchallenging adventure movie - perfect for the Christmas season."
"Momoa Kidman Wilson and others are there to service the script even when it gets cheesy and it does get cheesy indeed but the film's warmheartedness and clarity of purpose win out in the end."
"In short Aquaman has tons of basic dialogues a finite plot... and battles in hundreds of liters of water. [Full review in Spanish]"
"The film's real heroes are the SFX wizards and the production design team. They have really surpassed themselves creating fantastic underwater realms and making them teem with even more fantastical creatures."
"Aquaman is dumb and loud and really dumb and too long and dumb but also wonderfully creative and shameless; it's both the superhero film we need and the one we deserve."
"A strong effective story that makes the Aquaman character feel like a genuinely big deal... A triumph. Go and see this big 'n' loud as soon as you possibly can."
"Even with its flaws and struggles with originality Aquaman is reminiscent of the early Marvel movies in its storytelling best when taking wild swings instead of being an earnest superhero jam."
"Plot-wise the result is a hot foamy mess my friends but a mess that washed over me like a tidal wave."
"[A] nonstop rollercoaster ride of heart-pounding action eye-popping visual spectacle and all-around crowd-pleasing blockbuster entertainment that is insanely enjoyable to watch."
"Should I cheer? Should I laugh? Is everyone okay? Aquaman is one strange movie but certainly a fun one."
"With charismatic leads and some sublime visuals that overpower the ridiculous Aquaman is DC's second good movie and first real statement piece since 2013."
""Aquaman" is weird and corny and fun but it would have been more fun if the weirdness and corniness had been dialed up to 11."
"What DC's Aquaman movie lacks in refinement it makes up for with action spectacle and a whole lot of fun personality from Momoa's Arthur Curry."
"Mercifully the scale is reduced to a more human size for the last action sequence which allows Momoa and Wilson to show off their posing and trident skills which are considerable. The film is sure to be a rich source of desktop backgrounds."
"Aquaman's as formulaic excessively thrashy and mommy-obsessed as any other entry in the DCEU but its visual imagination is genuinely exciting and transportive and dare I say fun."
"As deeply entertaining as Aquaman proves to be its full potential hasn't even begun to break the surface."
"Aquaman contains a one-on-one gladiator-style battle underwater and surrounded by lava. An octopus is also on the drums hyping up the fight. That's not even the craziest image in this aquatic adventure"
"The character engagement is minimal and Wan doesn't make enough use of the charismatic Jason Momoa in the titular role however there's a certain allure to the weird and wild places the film is willing to go on its bloated voyage."
"There is plenty here to admire and enjoy. Too much really."
"Aquaman works because it isn't laughing at itself-it's both joyously whimsical and confident in its own sea-worthiness."
"Wan has taken a seemingly impossible task and imbued it with clarity and personality."
""Aquaman" is pure camp wildly entertaining and an eye-popping spectacle. You have to admire the effort scope and sheer audacity of everyone involved."
"James Wan has absolutely no sense of taste but he has a grand sense of scale which he leverages throughout the ludicrously insane but fun Aquaman to great effect."
"Swims into cinemas on a high tide of stunning CGI and waves of superhero comic book action."
"Aquaman is imaginatively ambitious superhero cinema with no rules which is more positive than negative as Wan's vision is realized like an underwater laser light spectacle that the DCEU so desperately needs right now."
"As brain-dead fun this movie is smarter than you think."
"It's a Saturday morning cartoon with an insane budget. The visual effects are stunning but there are a lot of narrative and pacing issues...the movie saves itself continuously with phenomenal action sequences."
"Wan seems to be operating under the philosophy that sci-fi/fantasy should stretch the limits of the imagination even at the cost of possibly looking ludicrous. Either way you're in for a spectacle."
"[A]s soon as [James] Wan's able to free the beast at ... the film's midway point Aquaman realizes its potential as a show-stopping blockbuster oddity."
"What follows is a straightforward superhero adventure - but it is all heightened by a couple of standout factors."
"It's 2018 and I bought an Aquaman movie...it's Momoa or bust...the more I think about it the more I like it."
"There are a lot of things that work. The writing isn't the best though and there are a lot of repetitive shots...just barely it works."
"In making the first DC superhero film in a long time to aspire to anything like levity Wan finds a way to catalyze what might have been yet another dust-dry origin story."
"It looks as if we've finally got what we've long asked for: a superhero with the looks and attitude of a forgiving bouncer in a Venice Beach heavy metal bar."
"[Aquaman[ has seven seas' worth of the simpler kind of wonder the razzle-dazzle imaginative kind."
"After the sombre slogs of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and Justice League it's refreshing to see a hero that doesn't take himself so seriously."
"Wan has a great visual eye or at very least a master's degree in CGI."
"Aquaman needs its smirking beer-loving roadie-looking Chippendale-chested hero -- not to save the day but to remind us that this is stuff is about as goofy as it gets."
"You're just waiting for the wild final act when Wan fully embraces the metal promises of this Aquaman concept and we get to witness Arthur fighting fishmonsters and Mera straddling an Orca as she rides into a psychedelic subaquatic battle."
"A thoroughly entertaining ride."
"Kinda fun mostly due to Momoa's charisma and presence and the underlying sense of levity. Aquaman doesn't suck any more but he definitely needs a better vehicle than this."
"Sorry Charlie 'Aquaman' is a blast."
"Aquaman is so unapologetically over-the-top its madness is undeniably entertaining."
"Entertainment value limited to humor and big visual mastery "Aquaman" does mark forward progress for the DC universe."
"There are parts of Aquaman that are so wonderfully strange that it's astonishing to see them in a franchise blockbuster."
"Big in every way  but fortunately not ALL wet thanks to a lively Jason Momoa and some terrific underwater visual effects."
"It's a hoot."
"Aquaman is a colorful action-packed spectacle with a somewhat feeble plot. Jason Momoa gives our hero a sardonic smile and punishing physical presence."
"Just plain fun and manages to establish the franchise as a solid pillar to stand alongside Batman Superman and Wonder Woman."
"Aquaman is fun. It's a lot of fun! Especially if you are willing to shut your brain off and enjoy the movie on the level it is intended."
"Hollywood has given us the greatest goofiest holiday gift in a long time."
"The glee that director James Wan clearly has playing in the world of Aquaman is infectious. He's made a movie for both types of 10-year-olds: literal kids and those who are 10 at heart."
"Somehow manages to be the perfect blend of Star Wars Lord of the Rings and even a little Indiana Jones yet still manages to be its very own thing."
"The saving grace of director James Wan's great-looking and reasonably entertaining but also meandering and sometimes truly ridiculous Aquaman is that everyone from screenwriters through the talented cast seems to get the sheer waterlogged lunacy..."
"Not only sets the DC Films universe back on course but it also introduces a new bona fide movie star in Jason Mamoa."
""...a candy-colored underwater world that has humor and heart...If you can accept that people ride giant seahorses into battle you are going to have a blast at this film.""
"Like the title character the movie is nice to look but does itself a disservice by speaking."
"...so utterly entertaining wickedly inventive and insanely paced that it comes spinning into cinemas like a breath of fresh ocean air."
"Visually spectacular with an exquisite aqua colour palette the film is an inventive and immersive underwater fantasy firmly anchored by its larger than life star Jason Momoa."
"The world-building here is definitely the best of any non-Wonder Woman DCEU film the action sequences are first-rate and unlike in Zack Snyder's Superman films there's actually sunlight."
"A refreshing fast-moving visually inventive adventure that actually has some heart at the heart of all the epic battle scenes...though Aquaman honours superhero movie conventions it largely avoids that stale formulaic feel we're often forced to endure."
"Cheesy and ridiculous but also a surprising amount of fun."
"An epic adventure that takes audiences up in the air and down to the depths offering myth muscle and pure big screen scale."
"It's campy and miles over the top but fun in its loopy wouldn't-it-be-cool-to-breathe-under-water way."
"Wan swings for the fences in crafting arguably the most ambitious comic book film we've seen on the big screen yet."
"A film that luxuriates in all of the absolute dumbest nonsense of superhero comics."
"[Jason] Momoa's made for this sort of over-the-top action role and if we can't have him back romancing Khaleesi and leading the Dothraki then an Aquaman outing will just have to suffice."
"Aquaman breaks the mould. It's an authentically light-hearted brand of rubbish taking a tongue-in-cheek delight in its own absurdity."
"Rich and retro Aquaman is a higher form of adventure hokum. It is made to silence people who grew up saying "They don't make films like that any more.""
"Not since "Superman: The Movie" have I seen a DC comic book movie wear its heart on its sleeve unveiling every single element of the Aquaman lore with sheer unabashed excitement and enthusiasm."
"Jason Momoa shines in a lighter-hearted role and filmmaker James Wan fully embraces the plot's increasingly ridiculous gyrations."
"Not only it's surprisingly fun but also visually ambitious. [Full review in Portuguese]"
"Exciting visually stunning underwater lore..."
"Underwater origin story has lots of comic book action."
"Welcome to Aquaman where you won't have a clue what's going on but you won't be able to look away either."
"A spirited pulp-adventure that should make doubters take this fishy hero seriously."
"Veteran cinematographer Don Burgess's widescreen images beguile and Bill Brzeski's production design impresses mightily but next time someone please give Momoa and company some memorable dialogue."
"If Aquaman breezes past philosophical dilemmas to get right to the mayhem at least Wan and company commit to said mayhem 100 percent."
"A fun exciting imaginative occasionally silly but undoubtedly epic adventure that establishes an incredibly rich new cinematic world."
"James Wan knows how to have fun with absurd material without making fun of it."
"Offers something that suddenly seems revolutionary -- a superhero movie for... comic book fans. Nearly every exaggerated Day-Glo frame feels like it was pulled from a hand-drawn panel."
"Aquaman is a step toward restoring equilibrium creating a sprawling undersea world that most closely resembles the Thor franchise in terms of scope majesty and happily humor."
"It feels like a step in the right direction for the DCEU. What's more its hero's former 'joke character' status is kept well at bay."
"For all its wild spectacle and cartoon cleverness this is a quietly subversive movie and an evolutionary step forward for the genre."
"As superhero origin stories go it's actually an improvement over most of the movies based on DC comics."
"Wan's descent into comic book fantasia is close to incredible even its frequent missteps overflowing in an infectious giddy fervor that's close to wonderful."
"Through it all Momoa's muscle ripple as the camera objectifies his beauty in a way that is usually restricted to women."
"[Aquaman's] delightful silliness does point to what these movies should have been doing all along: standing alone rather than trying to reconcile the weird worlds of its various heroes for premature team-ups."
"Obviously there are some negatives here. Still AQUAMAN is a hard movie not to recommend. It is often funny has a good heart and its star proves incredibly endearing."
"Action romance and adventure: It's all here in 'Aquaman.'"
"It took a while but the DC Extended Universe finally has embraced the inherent silliness of superheroes."
"Like the Star Wars prequels like Avatar it's a movie with tons of problems but it also contains images that made me catch my breath - gorgeous and even numinous sights I will remember forever."
"This is grandiose big-budget entertainment at its most self-aware and even when it swings and misses it's still a sight to behold."
"A fish-folk tale making a spectacle of itself... mindless and muddled with glimmers of grandeur. In truth Aquaman's appeal is strictly tied to Momoa's enthusiasm: it's infectiously sexy."
"It is rousing fare made with enough conviction for it to get away with its moments of extreme kitsch silliness."
"Aquaman actually breaks the dour DC mold and delivers a gonzo highly inventive piece of entertainment that has a surprisingly fresh vision overseen by director James Wan."
"When Dolph Lundgren riding a giant seahorse is the least crazy thing in a movie you know it's taking you to some outrageous places."
"This action movie has a fair amount of humor in it. Jason Momoa seems to embody the right combination of imposing physique and jovial good nature to pull this off."
"Notwithstanding the inevitable formulaic dialogue and a superabundance of boilerplate superhero action sequences "Aquaman" turns out to be almost despite itself an engaging undersea extravaganza."
"It's 200000 leagues over the top!"
"Aquaman it's worth repeating is gorgeous the set-pieces across the various kingdoms of the underwater realm examples of artists allowed to not just hew close to the messed-up source but indulge in their own inspirations as well."
"Is it too long? Yeah probably. Does it contradict some of the things we learned about Aquaman in the Justice League movie? Nothing important. The elements that work far outweigh the ones that don't."
"A big dumb acid-trip of a super-hero movie - relentless noisy entertaining nonsense with trippy sight gags like a drum-playing octopus and a wedding dress made of jellyfish."
"It's as splashy action-packed and utterly bonkers as you'd expect a story about a fishy fella who can save the world would be."
"One of the most enjoyable movies in the so-called DC Universe...its cheeky sense of humor and striking visuals make it a better-than-average example of the genre."
"Aquaman is the king of the seas just put your brain on pause and let the movie wash over you."
"Beautifully silly and tons of fun."
"Aquaman isn't all dumb fighting and arguing among sea-guys. The movie's biggest selling points are its affable bear-hug spirit and its lavish loopy visuals."
"Aquaman is rough around the edges but nevertheless an enjoyably silly ride that unabashedly embraces the cheesiness and weirdness of its world and runs -- er swims -- with it at full speed."
"A fast-paced free-for-all with fantastic special effects and a solid story about a troubled young man who finds himself the last hope for two worlds."
"This is my 2nd favorite DC movie one of my favorite superhero movies and one of my favorite movies of all time. The acting was stupendous especially from James Momoa Amber Heard Nicole Kidman Patrick Wilson and William Defoe. The cinematography was beautifully done. The costume design were excellent I especially loved all of Aquaman's different costumes. The visual effects were spectacular especially all of the creatures and the underwater scenes. The action scenes were incredible especially the final battle. The direction that James Wan took the movie was fantastic. The tone of the movie was terrific with it being both funny and serious. The writing and story were great. A+."
"I really like this one. The changes in the portrayal of aquaman compared to the Justice League cartoon I saw as a kid growing up in the 80's were welcomed changes. Jason Momoa is a great fit for how this Aquaman is like."
"Better than I thought it would be!!"
"Great to see a REAL man in a movie. Jason is spectacular. Seen it twice and it only gets better. The MCU can't touch this!"
"If he wasnt so hot i wouldnt of finished the movie it was boring"
"Parts of this were good but seemed forced at times. Also why os Aquaman afraid of falling from a low story building even though he jumped out of an airplane. Better than most of the DC movies but just an average movie with a predictable storyline."
"Too much water. - IGN 6/10"
"please dont watch this really its not good and i watch my money back"
"It's exceeded expectations."
"Aqua man was great! The world buildingthe characters were fully realized and their powers were on point. Mera was the scene stealer great work by Jason & Amber. This one is a major step up and a turn around for the DCEU"
"It�(TM)s like watching 30 short films but they�(TM)re all bad with themes that don�(TM)t match the plot and it�(TM)s sooooooo boring"
"It was a fun movie to go see. Was a little to cheesy for me to give it a high score but I dont feel like it was wasted money or anything. wish they would have made it more serious and grittier like man of steel... buuuut oh well..."
"I absolutely loved it. One of the best super hero movies yet"
"Fun movie. Worth a watch in the theaters"
"The best live-action comic book accurate in looks movie I have ever seen. I love this version of Aquaman played by Jason Momoa. He is bad-ass hilarious and does not thankfully have the cringe original costume. The introduce the kind of costume but they made it not look like a 60s animated show. The main villains were ok but their costumes were incredibly amazing. They were Ocean Master and Black Manta portrayed by Patrick Wilson and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II. They were great actors. But Black Manta was so underused. They introduced his origin just to throw him into future DCEU films. And unfortunately there were so many opportunities to show his expertise and show how much he really hates Aquaman. So plot holes... it's a DCEU movie what did you expect is what I would've been expected to say but there weren't noticeable if there were any. The special effects were ok but at points they would be fantastic.Also the big loud explosions in a very silent moment that would go of to make a 'jumpscare'. This would be fine if it didn't happen 6 times throughout the movie. Also it would be predictable on about the 3rd time as the background sound or music would either stop or quiet down. Previously in the best film of 2017 the Justice League - they introduced the idea of Atlanteans not being able to speak underwater. Luckily the great Amber Heard actress who portrayed Mera used her powers saying that she did not have to use them in the last DCEU film. Also the special effects used with Mera powers were incredible especially the scene in the town with Aquaman V Black Manta. That scene was so bad-ass. Also the flashback scenes were needed to show what it's like to be Aquaman with his abilities learning and training.One irritating problem was Kekoa Kekumano scene as Aquaman started off cool but this is supposed to be Jason's Aquaman as about 20 or 21 something like that yet the way he speaks and sounds - is more like he's 14. It just really annoyed me. Also not a good amount of humor. I would call this an adventure film. I had a lot of laughs. I am 99% sure that this will change the silly look of him in comics. This is the beginning of a new DCEU.Grade: A"
"I liked the movie just... THE ENDING! The ending was horrible. I think that Ocean Master should have killed his mother when him and Arthur where about to fight. That's all I need to say about this movie."
"Overall Aquaman is an enjoyable movie to watch. The plot was a pretty typical origin story the characters were developed fairly well the action sequences were good the special effects were a little inconsistent but overall ok. The acting was ok and the casting was good."
"I hope this marks a new direction for the DCEU. The Characters are fun the story is epic with hints of goofiness and the look and feel are very fresh."
"I felt they did a great job moving the story forward. Good balance of acting technology depth of characters and their archs."
"As long as you don't go in expecting too much it's a fun movie with some great special effects."
"This was a unique and fun movie. I have heard multiple complaints that the CGI wasn't very good. I strongly disagree. The CGI looked fantastic and it was a film that we haven't seen yet. The CGI in particular under water was a very beautiful and it looked extremely realistic. A pretty strong addition to the DC Universe and it's one that I'll watch again."
"Decent movie and scenes."
"Good enough but it had forced comedy on some parts"
"great movie and has a lot of exciting action"
"Awesome movie!!! Loved it!!! A must see!!!"
"It was a lot better than the trainwreck I expected it to be."
"As DC movies go it was good flawed in some areas but was an enjoyable movie all round"
"Fantastic from start to finish. Better than the other DCEU movies!"
"Visuals great. Acting Ok. Story Ok. Enough Action to keep you entertained."
"It may not be perfect but it was an amazing movie the comic costume Action scenes & CGI were absolutely stunning best DCEU film so far along side with Wonder Woman and Probably Man of Steel."
"I understand the difficulty to create a credible film underwater but Aquaman was indeed not much better than expected. A lot of special effects some humor and a very typical superhero story "I'm the only one who can save the day. Oh and I'm the son of the queen". How creative. Very poor soundtrack too. Momoa and Heard did a really good job and Patrick Wilson's performance was 10/10. Still better than most DC movies."
"Great movie! Action sequences and CGI were pretty good. Movie gets a bit messy in the middle but it has an awesome climax. A cool and styled direction from James Wan. A kickass movie. Amber heard and Nicole Kidman's performances were good. Jason Momoa completely nailed his role. Underwater sequences were mind blowing!"
"It was phenomenal ocean fantasy movie I've ever seen. I think DC is getting developed and learning from their own mistakes. Jams Wan did really hard work on this film. Everything was beautiful. so colorful but not childish. after the Man Of Steel. DC universe it's been so dark. But Aquaman did break the rules"
"The visual effects are phenomenal. it was fantastic. I wached this movie twice. but I didn't get bored. at all. James Wan did a hard work. and you don't disappoint on this movie at all"
"An all-around fun film. The characters were constantly drawn into mesmeric action sequences leaving the viewer no time to feel bored and the necessarily massive amount of CG visuals only helped buoy the story not hinder it. Acting plot and character development do take a back seat throughout but they don't have to be fleshed out for this film to be enjoyable. Surprisingly vivid and colorful aesthetics given director James Wan's prolific horror-focused past."
"Was fantastic movie."
"Typical comic story. Well delivered. Aquaman has built a new world to explore."
"Great watch! I will definitely go see aquaman again"
"Worst movie of 2018."
"The dialogue was super cheesy and cringe inducing but the visual effects are so magnificent I would sit through the cheesy movie again and again."
"The writing may be horrid and compared to the other hero flicks being pushed out nowadays this film is mediocre. Despite this compared to the other films the DCEU has to offer this is one of the best and putting the DCEU and MCU aside this is a very fun film with some great lead performances and some stunning effects. I give Aquaman a B"
"Good movie. Drew me in. Only problems with it I saw was that they used a line twice and it didn't make sense and they didn't explain who has what abilities. Also I'm sad all the other DC movies couldn't have been this good. Can Aquaman join Marvel?"
"Me sorprendio bastante fue mucho mejor de lo que esperaba"
"Very puerile and silly most of the time yet visually entertaining indeed. It is axiomatic that children are the main target audience of this film. Then taking this fact into account all of those puerile and over-dramatic scenes are sort of justified; it did its job rather well. However its poor structure and shoddy demonstration are still there and it is difficult to ignore."
"Boring Makes no sense Same old DC dissapointment"
"This movie very enjoy it."
"Fun movie and well acted but way too predictable and a half hour too long."
"Best movie DC has made in the past Decade Stunning visuals and decent acting make for a Good movie."
"This movie is pretty bad and absolutely absurd. It's an absolute blast. Watch it on a Friday night when you just want to have fun."
"Despite some flaws and weaknesses this is one hell of a movie ride. For me this one of the best DCEU-films alongside Wonder Woman. The concept and setting feels like something you have not seen much in either the MCU or DCEU universe. The legend of Atlantis has never felt more alive than with this movie. Great battles and action sequences on land and sea makes Aquaman a One-To-Watch. If you like superhero flicks with a small twist this one� 1/2(TM)s for you."
"Not very relatable emotionally impacting or inspiring but thanks for all the fish! ^_^"
"Momoa brings aquaman to life and also being funny while doing it overall aquaman is a good entry to the DCEU"
"I pretty enjoyfull movie the way they created Atlantis is outstanding to how things happen inside the water Jason even if a lot of people thought that his look is way different and nothing matchable to the original aquaman his acting of the character is gold. The villian is not one of those usual "I'm an evil killer machine that wants the bad in the all world" he is a man who wants the best for his people and just like aquaman himself protect the people that he loves (but only the atlantis people) the locations they go and the environment connects with the story and I love how James Swan took away all the Zach Snyder idea of making the movies dark and took a way of clean comedy good action scenes and COLOR around them depending in where they are. One of the best no the best installment DC had done 'till now this could be the DC renaissance in the movie marketing and I'm definitely looking forward for future projects."
"Good but really long."
"Walking into this movie I had very mixed expectations. On one hand you have this fantastic and unique interpretation of a classic character paired with an epic trailer that really boosted my urge to see the movie. However I also knew that I was walking into a DC movie franchise that had failed (for the most part) to impress me despite all the hype I build up in my head for the past few years. Aquaman ended up pretty much meeting both of these conflicting ideas right in the middle. As stated I had never really seen any interpretation of Aquaman like this outside of this cinematic universe and they pulled it off beautifully. A pretty classic story line for the character was played out well. The only thing that really killed it for me was the occasional over dramatic or cliche moments. Certain lines just really stuck out as goofy to me. The underwater scenes were beautiful there was some really work done there."
"Funny and pretty good."
"Over winter break I was in Brooklyn and the theatre near us had limited screenings. One of them was Aquaman. As we were on the subway debating what to see my mom advocated for Aquaman but I told her I hadn�(TM)t seen the trailer; so she summed it up for me saying �Superhero struggles. Superhero comes to the rescue. And superhero saves the world and all is good.�? Well honestly that�(TM)s all I really needed because that�(TM)s all there was to Aquaman. The movie ran for 2 hours and 22 minutes so you would think there would be more depth or something calling for your full attention but that proved to be incorrect. To sum it up in time the first thirty minutes was background information just letting you know how Aquaman just like any other superhero has some sort of �special�? thing about him. Mainly he has trouble with who he is his identity. Moving on you have the pretty girl who tells him the world needs him and for a little bit you see him struggle� again. Not too determined for a hero. Anyway after that he starts to fight with the villains which goes on for about an hour. Personally I wasn�(TM)t a fan of watching the testosterone filled men fight but if you like that maybe Aquaman is for you! Then we have the last half hour or so where everything comes together� almost. While that is a vague conclusion to the movie I would like to prevent any possible spoilers. I am aware this may be an unpopular opinion; however I really just think the message that Aquaman sends (Aquaman the person) is not one that we should be teaching the American youth. Violence having to be convinced to help and arrogant impulsiveness. I will credit him for being humble. I would never stop someone from watching a movie and I think everyone should have their own opinion. But I would think before I went on to spend money to watch it. Don�(TM)t be arrogantly impulsive :)"
"Aquaman es basica pero entretenidaUna cinta plagada de CGI y chiste de pastelazo es lo que el director James Wan logra sacar de Este film Un vistazo a sus personajes hace que esta historia sea un cliche comun en el DCU."
"Pretty good other than the useless character of the black-ray..."
"It can be hard to make a superhero movie "cool" without completely reworking the characters (as Marvel has done with many many different characters - think Hawkeye or Mysterio) but somehow Aquaman manages to be a killer flick while maintaining the older designs of characters like Black Manta.  The couple of friends I saw the movie with all left the theater complaining about the film's cheesiness but I thought it was somewhat refreshing. Of course DC has a long way to go before it reaches Marvel levels of "suave" but as far as those DC movies go this one actually wasn't too cheesy. The special effects weren't over the top there was plenty of comic relief and the plot was actually pretty innovative - I'd say the only cheesy part of the movie was the fact that it was just that: a superhero movie. Overall I thought Aquaman was one of the better superhero movies I had seen in the past year or so - lighthearted but not to the point of cheesiness."
"Ok before I start I just want to make one thing clear the actors in this movie were great. I feel like with the script they were given they created a strong connection with their character and during many points of the movie I forgot Momoa ever did have other roles and solely thought of him as Aquaman. However even with such great casting I was very disappointed with the writers of this movie. In so many places there was uncalled for over cheesy dialog that added nothing to the movie. Truly it was cringy. If the director would have allowed Mamoa to maybe improv a little more the movie would have had a more authentic touch that it was sorely lacking. Mamoa himself had some great oneliners but those were overall scarce. The action scenes were also too much It felt like every five minutes someone had to punch someone else or DC would be upset. In the beginning it was nice and well put together but after the 4th fight scene I was over it. Finally the last thing that made me give this movie 2.5 stars was the poorly developed love story. Just because a girl and a guy are both the only good people in a movie doesn't mean they need to get together. The love story to say the elast was not good the connection between Mamoa's character and Heard's character was poorly developed and it just felt like midway through the movie they were forced to like each other all of a sudden. If the directors maybe would have surprised us and made them stay as friends I think I would have enjoyed the movie more without the unnecessary lovey-dovey drama."
"Visual treat for adventure movie with a lot of entertaining moments."
"Aquaman was an exciting movie full of big spots. The first act was slow but it slowly picked itself up and ended in an incredible third act. Overall this was an enjoyable movie."
"Probably the worst movie I have seen in awhile. Terrible script directing and don�(TM)t get me started on the CGI. They made a great actress like Nicole Kidman seem like a bad actor in this movie. Cheesy over all and not funny. Wow this was a terrible movie. Good thing I didn't have to pay for it."
"You are not funny please quit trying"
"Cheesy and bright it shows a fun long adventure but requires a type of bright tone to watch while most superhero movies now adays go in a darker direction this definitely does not."
"Awful dialog. The CGI was inconsistent. The musical score was an odd choice. A much lighter tone than the other DC movies. Unfortunately a very uneven story with poor character development."
"I really liked the movie. Action good actors and engaging for all its lenght.suggested. Jason Momoa good as always."
"Beyond my expectations"
"Great movie i loved it."
"Good old fashioned fun and the sea monsters were very cool. Cheesy at times."
"The movie felt like a mush of different films I've seen before Sword in the Stone Atlantis Little Mermaid Percy Jackson and Song of the Sea. Taking into a count that they had two years to develop an underwater world with a consistent plot I'd have to say that this was a flop at an attempt. The graphics were also a little iffy when real sea creatures were on screen (how you make a shark look fake I don't know) and overall I found the themes used in the movie repetitive."
"this movie looks awesome"
"The acting was weird. It seemed extremely unconfortable . That doesnt necessarily mean the movie is terrible just extremely hard to sit through. The only saving grace of this extremely mediocre movie is the action and the absolutely beautiful backgrounds and Jason Mamoa's performance as aquaman which was actually good to my surprise"
"I would personally describe this movie as acceptable at best. Looks wise it was great. I enjoyed the action scenes and the effect when creating the underwater cities as well as all other aspects of the viewing. However story and character wise I was left somewhat disappointed. Maybe it's because of my background with the comics but I found the entire plot extremely predictable as if I knew what was going to happen five minutes before it would happen. Because of this I found the romance between Aquaman and Mera to be extremely forced and not natural at all as if they were destined to fall in love since before they met. Along with that I found Arthur's character development decent but a problem arises when we consider Black Manta's story alongside. His story was much more compelling and heart-wrenching than Aquaman's it made me genuinely disappointed at his ending and wanting him to succeed above Aquaman. This is obviously a problem when considering Aquaman is supposed to be the hero of the story. Also and this may just be me but what humor there was was simply not hitting for me just coming off as cringey to me. However as mentioned before this is sort of made up for due to the amazing visuals/effects and overall acceptable at best."
"Aquaman's spectacular visual effects that exceeds even that of AVATAR and fun content are superb enough to forgive the film's disorganized and capricious behavior jumping between genres a little too often such as changing from a love story to a superhero flick to a horror movie."
"Visually amazing. FXs were beyond awesome. Under-developed villain (Black Manta)"
"AquamanGlorious cliche'd feast that keeps you wanting for more. Visually fancy tidy plot and well casted characters makes Aquaman one of the most entertaining underwater adventure film this decade."
"This was a great rendition of Aquaman with a modern flare."
"awesome so far. But didn't feel complete which most probably might be in part 2. looking forward to it. Aquaman owned it with his simple and quirky ways."
"awesome so far. But didn't feel complete which most probably might be in part 2. looking forward to it. Aquaman owned it with his simple and quirky ways."
"A Feast for the eyes ( as per Visual Effects) A good story line but not the first of its kind. Overall Aquaman is a good entertainer."
"Extraordinary movie..real eyefeast..James Wan's awesome direction"
"I enjoyed Aquaman for the most part and it was way better than any other DC movie but there were some criticisms 1) Aquaman's characterizations feels like the writers were like let's take the snakiness of Peter Parker Peter Quill and Tony Stark and mix it with Wolverine. What I mean by this is he feels like a version of better characters rather than his own character most of the time. 2) Aquaman tries too hard to be badass. Literally yelling "badass" at times as if urging us to think he is cool. Just be cool man. 3) The movie does not know how to transition into action scenes. Literally every action scene starts with an "unexpected explosion." The heroes are having a conversation and as soon as it ends they are thrown across the room by an explosion and a fight ensues. This is the only way conflict is initiated and it gets tedious. 4) If I were Aquaman I would change my title to Ocean Master because that is a way better name."
"Decent movie just the colors were to bright and the costumes look to much like cartoons. I think that costumes should look comic book accurate but Aquaman takes it to far."
"The greatest DCEU movie of all time"
"It's alright. I guess it's enjoyable enough. Your not going to lose sleepif you haven't seen it but you might enjoy it."
"Normally I'm more into Marvel movies but I have to say this movie blew most of the super hero movies I've seen right out of the water!(mind my pun). It was a fun adventure filled with the super hero genres usual witty humor and the story also had a lot of heart to it! If the DCEU keeps pumping movies like this out I might have to switch sides."
"this movie was really surprising in the way that it was good"
"It's okay. The movie takes plot lines from other movies and just puts them into this movie. It's a decent origin story but nothing to go wow I have to see that again. It's a DC movie after all. It's nothing like Man of Steel or any Marvel movie. I can be bias. I am a huge Marvel fan but I am willing to give everything a first shot to impress me with something I haven't really seen before. This didn't do it for me.SPOILER ALERT IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT Certain music especially the synths are just a rip off of the style used in Thor Ragnarok the 'ring of fire' is just another way of saying battle to the death like in Black Panther he needs to use water in the desert to activate an ancient scroll thing... Hmm where have I seen that before? Oh right The Fifth Element and there is a huge Kraken thing like in Pacific Rim. The battle scene between the brothers is cool and kept my interest and the movie has its funny moments and overall bad ass-ness from Jason Momoa and Amber Heard is f***ing hot but I can't help and think that within 2 and a half hours it's still kept at a decently fast pace. Think like... Captain America: Civil War without all the movies leading up to it. It kind of starts you at a interesting place and fills in the gaps as the movie progresses. Just my personal opinion."
"I feel i should eat fish! they would be delicious however it taste disgusting it was a disaster but they always put good green screen effect...."
"While I give massive props to the CGI department on this film I found the plot was both excruciatingly predictable and riddeled with holes. In saying that it is an easy to watch film that would keeps children and young teens entertained."
"I loved Unbreakable and Split so had to see the sequel and OMG it was awesome!!! Critics just don't get it. If you liked the prequels you will love this movie!!"
"Super green screened and half the movie was aqua man pretending to be dumb funny while being lectured by a feminist bitch."
"Glad to see the DCEU make a comeback James Wan has deliver a CGI spectacle. Jason Momoa as Aquaman delivers Amber Heard as Mera is amazing and Patrick Wilson is striking as King Orm. Its good to see the DCEU go full comic book with no apologies job well done."
"This stands alone and proud from all thr other Dc films its fast paced comic book style action it really does put a smile on your face as it tells an origin story of Aquaman that is thrilling and true to the comics"
"Dare I say it could have used a little less action? And perhaps a liltle less Star Wars type battle towards the end. I am sure young one will love it."
"Very entertaining story on where Aquaman came from. Lots of action and great acting."
"Fun predictable action film with great effects. Filled me with energy and made me laugh."
"Exactly what you think/hope it will be. If you like Aquaman in 'Justice League' you'll enjoy this. Mamoa is one of few Super Hero actors you actually believe could be a superhero. The story was a little thin but good action good humor and even a little romance. Grab your popcorn and go!"
"Completely bonkers and action-packed non-stop fun! Something we needed in a DC movie!"
"Visually beautiful. Cool protagonist. Good story. Redeemable villain. Villain having understandable motivations. Best dceu movie by far."
"The AquaToothpaste Man is a film designed for teenagers and is very funny unintentionally in parts."
"So having watched prior DC movies I was worried if this movie would be good or not. However upon seeing it I realize the DCEU is getting back on its feet. Having watched Game of Thrones I wondered how well Jason Momoa would do he nailed it! Serious when necessary halarious at good moments and honestly I feel like after a few more Aquaman movies he may become the new face of the hero that will be well remembered."
"Wonderful screenplay and high on visual effects. Watched it in 3D and felt they have really worked hard towards making the 3D version a success. Usually I am not fan of 3D movies because the effects are not really up to the mark but some of the sequences that this movie had really looked resplendent in 3D. Treat to watch if you're a fan of good visual films with some action."
"If Wonder Woman was the DCEU�(TM)s equivalent to Captain America: The First Avenger then Aquaman is its Thor. But there�(TM)s another more recent and apt comparison �" Venom. Yep. Both are dumb trashy critic-proof outings that relied entirely upon the charisma of its main lead and yes�both are fun as hell. Because you know. Comic book movies are supposed to be colorful and fun on occasion. Plot is�irrelevant and you won�(TM)t remember a month later. You�(TM)re here for probably two reasons: Jason Momoa and/or Amber Heard. (Admit it.) Momoa is by no means a great actor but he possesses great comedic timing and he allows his physicality to act for him to the joy of the female audience no doubt. He appears to enjoy himself and for a fluffy picture of this nature this is enough. Amber Heard is better on the acting side of the equation but she has little romantic chemistry with Momoa. What saves their scenes is a generous helping of comedy and the sheer fact that both are ridiculously good-looking people grinning their way through the explosions.There are a lot of problems. It�(TM)s overstuffed the second act is a slog performances are off the CGI probably won�(TM)t age well in ten years and the whole thing is a bit goofy to be honest. I mean yes it�(TM)s a goddamn Aquaman movie �" you have to admire how straight they went with this. But it�(TM)s jarring at times. Willem Dafoe Nicole Kidman and Patrick Wilson are quite good and the final battle is an Avatar-esque barn burner of a set piece. Director James Wan is quite good at giving audience pleasing thrills and it�(TM)s no surprise he delivers those here. I personally found it to be an alright experience but I suspect Shazam! will provide the farce that I prefer. You�(TM)ve already seen this but if you haven�(TM)t then watch it on Netflix on a really big monitor. Got to experience those abs in high definition."
"One of the better films in the DCEU and much better than Justice League in many ways. Jason Momoa is great as Aquaman and he does has potential as a great actor. Amber Heard is fantastic as Mera and hope to see what she does in the future as an actress. The visual effects are beautiful and amazing. Can�(TM)t wait for the sequel."
"Great DC film since Dark Knight Rises box office as well as storline"
"One of the better DC films but sometimes it can feel its long"
"Not the most original superhero movie ever made and makes its Thor inspirations quite obvious however it is also a massive step in the right direction with creativity a well used cast attention to the little details humor and most importantly a major DC character finally getting the attention he'd been in need of for a long time while also demonstrating the DCEU's respect for female superheros that even the MCU and the Arrowverse have had trouble living to. While by no means the greatest superhero (or even the greatest DC movie ever made Aquaman creates hope for a positive future for the DC Extended Universe."
"Not being funny this is the first movie I have ever walked out of the cinema half way through. I also would've left earlier but was determined to give it a chance. It feels like it was written by the kool-aid man with the story intermittently punctured by exploding walls to give the impression of excitement."
"Aquaman was my favorite as a kid. This is not my Aquaman exactly but we enjoyed it. There may be hope for DC. If so Aquaman is it."
"The "Ocean Master" ... so funny :D"
"Saw it in 4D added to the whole experience! Very good for a DC movie!"
"Underrated to be honest"
"I liked Aquaman and it was suitably fun for a DC movie"
"So it's time for me to tell me my opinion about this movie. Aquaman of course this film is not the best in Universe of DCbut he is better then Justice League. Although Aquaman have big claims. At first the villain turned out to be without motives and as always threatened the destruction of mankind. At second boring dialogues that added boredom and at third unfunny jokes. But I found merits: good plot action visual effectsbeautiful atmosphere. And very well soundtrack.DC after all they have a lot of potential but they just will not realize it to the desired level and so it upsets me. My opinion: Aquaman is the best film of DC Extended Universe but compared to Marvel he is inferior."
"Has some great moments and visuals but is let down entirely by bad character and set design. Parts feel like a low budget attempt at a Power Ranger movie with corny 90� 1/2 1/2(TM)s-action- movie lines thrown amongst other clunky dialogue."
"ABSURDLY TERRIBLY WRITTEN DIRECTED AND PRODUCED.Soubdtrack couldn� 1/2 1/2(TM)t be worse. Or could.Silly and redundant. It SHOULD be more realistic. A realistic fantasy such as Avatar or even Superman."
"Beautiful and high in action and story Aqua-man embodies why people go to the movies. To see over the top mind blowing works of art that make us believe in fantasy along with characters that we can relate to or at least feel and understand. This film turns around any criticism or mockery of Aqua-man's character enthusiastically played by Jasson Mamoa and turns it into prais and complements. Aqua-man's is the kind of movie that film makers should strive to create."
"Aquaman gives great special effects funny and well developed characters and a series of jokes. The problem is that in the second act the film turns boring and its its long duration does not help much. What is the obsession to exploit a place just when the characters are in the middle of something important?"
"I really enjoyed this movie though it was a bit on the long side and rather predictable. The first 45 min I found myself knowing what the next/punch lines would be...that didn't enthuse me but as it picked up so did my interest and I found myself very satisfied as far as Comic movies go."
"Unbelievable how the reviews are only in the upper 60s just saying don� 1/2(TM)t1/2(TM)t believe every review you see by the critics there� 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s a reason this movie is over a billion."
"The half-human half-Atlantean Arthur Curry heir to the underwater kingdom of Atlantis goes on a quest to prevent a war between the worlds of ocean and land. The colors and brightness were superb. I guess the big investment in the stunning visuals of this film eventually paid off after it became the highest-grossing film of the DCEU. Although very entertaining and epic and definitely not so dark some dialogue lines really caused me to raise an eyebrow. The score delighted me but some songs of the soundtrack are questionable. Enjoyable nonetheless!"
"Have you ever been so excited for a movie that it makes the movie nearly impossible to meet your expectations? Well this happened to me. It was a fun action packed creative movie but it didnt blow me away like I wanted it to."
"Under water action is amazing!!!!"
"Absolutely memorable movie. The exceptional direction by James Wan make the incredible Aquaman super hero be amazing and biggest on big screen. DC go ahead so well from here. Now they have the biggest super hero in a future now."
"awesome jason mamoa was the shit. Great movie about time DC"
"It might have been predictable but it was a visual masterpiece and gave out the extravagant comic book vibe with great success. It reminded me at times of several different stories drawn from the mythology of various countries. I consider the movie a modern mythos and I appreciate it a lot."
"Absolutely awful who thinks this is a good movie?? This was a 3rd rate version of Thor Ragnarock. They tried to be colorful and funny with multiple plot points. The only good oart of this movie was the Nicole Kidman storyline. The CGI is THE WORST. When you cant make sea turtles look real your underwater movie is gonna fail. The wig the red hair girl had on (yes i was so bored i didnt remember their names) was so cheap it looked like it was a dime store purchase. The "action" scenes were way too frequent and alot of times pointless other than to show their CGI was not even as passable as Injustice 2. The last fight was so ridiculous and cheap looking i mean crabs.....Spongebob looks better!!!! This movie was awful I have no idea how anyone thought this was great and yes I realize it was a record breaking movie for DC not hard to imagine because their films suck (except for Wonder Woman)."
"I would like to say this was a good movie but at some points I felt like I was watching a thor movie."
"In my opinion this was a underrated movie"
"a fun and fresh dc film with colorful visuals comedy that mostly sticks and adrenaline pumped action. but there are some negatives. things seem too convenient black manta was rather mishandled and the plot seems like they were making it up as they went. but a good film either way"
"So entertaining! One of the best films from DC characters!"
"Graphics are cool but storyline is all over the place and dialogue is awful."
"Riktigt bra film�'?�?��'?�?�"
"Featuring sleek CGI offering a visual spectacle into the colourful life of the outcast prince of Atlantis coupled with cheesy but witty writing DCEU did it right this time with Aquaman (2018) after the horrible superheroes team-up that was Justice League (2017) and also Batman V Superman (2016). This entry shows us that DC recognises its errors in the past and bears the intention to place themselves on the right path to secure the future of DCEU."
"For me this movie was one of the best of 2018 i love it! this movie is better than black panther! Aquaman is full action comedy and always you are attentive"
"For a director who is best known for directing horror films I have to say that James Wan did a pretty good job with this film! It also nice to see that DC Universe was finally able to give us a stand alone DC film that is good."
"Too long boring. There was SO much CGI that I just tuned out after the first 2 hours. When they did talk the story was SO dumb that I wanted to laugh out loud. I did not but the idiot behind me in the theater did. I guess they let him out of the asylum for the night but that I s another story.In short I cannot remember the last time I was so happy to FINALLY see the credits."
"There isn't as much humor as I had read about. CGI in DC movies still falls behind Marvel movies. Didn't feel or really relate to the Aquaman. Overly long but didn't feel that way. Just OK by me."
"I felt the character building was forced and often skipped over. Story as a whole was cool but I don't think the main characters got very tuned into their characters for lack of a better word. Also that romance was completely unnecessary and I think detracted from the movie as a whole. It looks beautiful but the characters leave you wanting."
"Entertaining however made no sense that he was wiping out his own people and then they embraced him later."
"I loved this movie. The subliminal messaging for ocean conservation was amazing"
"Way better than Justice League"
"While I actually like Jason Momoa in this role the script and dialogue leave a lot to be desired. The Black Manta storyline could have waited to be added either at the end of the movie or in the sequel. The acting is sub-par. DaFoe Kidman look embarassed to be delivering their lines while Heard is nothing but annoying Patrick Wilson (seriously - he's called the "Ocean Master"?) is wooden and laughable.I was disappointed. The storyline was too predictable."
"Never did I ever think that the best DC film I would ever watch in my life would be Aquaman but it is. Jason Momoa is great as Aquaman Amber Heard is great as Mera the visuals are actually colourful compared to previous DC films and the story it has to tell is engaging. Overall an awesome experience despite a somewhat rushed love story."
"The FX in the movie was extremely beautiful and story was compelling and easy to follow and the Aquaman movie possess something that not much DCEU movies has possessed recently. Hope! Although there were a few chessy lines the overall acting was superb. Patrick Wilson was awesome and the Ocean Master and wished there was a little more of him. A clear winner for me and a must be on Blu-Ray."
"Really good. Even with all the CGI it somehow felt more real than most of the superhero movies made these days. Not sure why."
"A boring movie with no intres or samthing new in it"
"This film sucks mondo dick"
"Maybe I saw a different movie than the positive reviewers but the Aquaman watched seemed like three plot lines smashed together in a slow lengthy snoozefest that was honestly pretty tough to follow. Perhaps I� 1/2(TM)m just burned out from all the superhero hero movies and tv shows. The writing was lackluster and tried to awkwardly force in one-liners in otherwise boring scenes. The Pirate plot line could have been left on the cutting room floor without losing any substance from the narrative. And the characters should have developed before the audience was asked to care about them at all. Instead of making one 2.3 hour movie DC should have picked an origin story then followed it up with a deeper dive into the political divisions between the seafolk. In the end it just felt like they were trying too hard to cram the entire Aquaman cannon into a single film which came off flat."
"The worst superhero movie I have ever seen� I was so surprised how awful it was..."
"Pitbull song? Eager for money know no limits. DC tries so hard and still always looks odd and creepy."
"It was very good definitely action packed; never a dull moment! It was super long though"
"Pros: CGI was impressive.Cons: Terrible writing characters are severely shallow and one-dimensional explosions are overused as a crutch to progress a lackluster plot."
"REALLY enjoyed it. Not too SJW preachy. Far better than most people and media critics are giving it credit for. What's more it has lasting power as I think back on it I see a LOT more good than bad."
"This was surprisingly okay. I didn't expect anything out of DCEU since it's dead (Wonder Woman is a fluke no matter what anyone says nothing they make is gonna be as good again) but Jason Momoa was ridiculously likeable and if you don't really care for plot and want a popcorn superhero flick this is for you. I'm especially impressed with how they pulled off the scenes underwater the CGI doesn't look as bad as I thought it would and it actually was fun to watch. Give it a go you won't be disappointed."
"There are literally only two women in the entire movie- the dead mom and the love interest. Arthur doesn't have much of a personality apart from one liners and being a 'manly man's that is honestly very cringy. He has bad hygiene and stinky armpits and wears leather. He drinks beer for breakfast and is very very dumb. I'd say it's a good thing he's pretty but it's honestly not enough to make up for his personality (or lack thereof). Mysteriously all the people under the sea/on Atlantis are white except for that one guy who appeared for 10 seconds to forge a trident and kneel before a broody king. Queen Mera is amazing but also is in the manic pixie girl trope where she exists solely to better Arthur's life and clean up his messes. It's never explained why Orm is so very wrong. They talk about the trash from the ocean crashing up on the shore as a bad thing. Typical of DC the mom exists only as a means to further the guys angst. Very badly reminiscent of the Martha scene. It is actually very cringe which is sad because I was excited to watch am a huge DC fan and went in with pretty low expectations"
"Finally a modern DC movie that i adore."
"It� 1/2 1/2(TM)s a really good comedy! That� 1/2 1/2(TM)s it."
"Awful. Terrible CGI and acting (except Kidman and Morrison). Had to at least give it half a star to be able to write this review. This is the worst "action-packed" film ever - ever! - made."
"I actually enjoyed it. A lot. It seems to me that every new movie has to follow specific standards or the other way around to be considered decent. Why can't everyone just watch it and see the good things it has instead of point out every bad aspect of it?"
"Awesome movie! Sexy exciting tons of good action with good story! Loved it!!!"
"Out of all the films in the DC Extended Universe I feel that Aquaman is the best and funniest movie. Jason Momoa does an excellent job portraying Aquaman with a lot of heart and tons of humour that easily connects you with his character. Director James Wan is one of my favourite directors and he has done a perfect job giving Aquaman his own great superhero movie. Aquaman is not in the same level as Marvel superhero movies but can still stand out in the crowd."
"The underwater scenes looked amazing. But the pacing was terrible they should have cut the black manta arc it only hurts the character. I know they tried to introduce him but man this movie was already too full packed. Some land scenes looked a little bit cheap and the love relationship looked so pushed and cringy. But the character Aquaman was well built and i don't know i want to see more."
"This one is a solid "meh". Nothing memorable but nothing unbearably bad either."
"I loved this movie! It is a modern day 80's sword and sorcery high adventure movie. I'm going back to watch it again!"
"Overall really good movie. Not one I would watch twice in the theater but looking forward to seeing it streaming."
"Finally a fun popcorn movie from DC"
"Cringey. CGI is so CGI why even bother."
"It's a pretty cool film but nothing I'd re watch multiple times"
"Very Dragged Out But It's Still "Alright""
"This standalone movie Kicks ...and leaves you happy n satisfied."
"I am 30 minutes in and this movie so just ruined � 1/2~The Conjuring� 1/2~ for me � 1/2~by association� 1/2(TM).....I am tapping out before it takes � 1/2~Machete� 1/2(TM) too"
"Aquaman is a total blast! It's super cheesy and throws literally everything at the screen. It's purposefully so bad it's good except it really isn't bad this is no Sharknado. I really appreciate what the filmmakers have done here they knew what they were going for and they did it. However it is by no means a great movie. It has a lot of narrative and pacing issues sometimes it will just randomly cut back to a flashback in the middle of a scene. There's one particular flashback where Aquaman is a teenager and whoever played him in that scene is a horrible actor it completely took me out of this scene which was supposed to be super serious. Also almost every single time there's a serious conversation going on something just explodes and then we're in another action scene; this happens so many times in the film. The villain is also pretty cliche I mean he somewhat works but he also somewhat doesn't. Although the secondary villain is actually pretty compelling. Other than that Aquaman is a blast from start to finish that is truly epic. B"
"One of the most badass superhero movies"
"Great movie better then expected"
"Large budget but DC failed to make a great hero movie. Still the best of the Justice League thus far though"
"I don�(TM)t like DC movies but Aquaman was a blast. Beginning to end the movie brings nothing but joy and awesome fight sequences. Even though some of the humor feels a little bit forced this movie is an awesome time for the family and gets me to like the Aquaman character."
"On my way to the theater I was expecting Aquaman to be out of this world but it almost disappointed me in this perspective. All throughout the movie Jason Momoa who played the main character Arthur Curry would let out corny one-liners. The graphics of this movie almost looked amateur - the computer generation was not the best. The movie followed a typical storyline you would expect to read in a child's storybook which Is okay but not ideal. The sea creatures in the salty waters all seemed to follow their natural instincts - besides the giant sea-horses the Atlantics would ride around and the giant octopus that happened to be able to play the drums. Some of the Atlantic mermaid-type creatures looked like they walked off the set of the 2009 Avatar movie; but with fish tails. On the other hand this movie had some good morals and was overall family friendly. Aquaman of course being a super hero movie had tons of action which definitely surpassed my expectations. In conclusion if you are wanting to see an action movie that has a storyline you can predict before it happens you like to see a lot of action and are okay with reoccurring themes then this is the movie for you."
"I quite liked it.I thought this film felt a bit rammed with content quite a lot going on in one film. However great action and a very good looking film that didn't take it self to serious witch was perfect for this film."
"This is a better than average superhero movie. Not the best but very watchable."
"Better than Spider-Man 2"
"If hadn´t some problems in the plot could be a perfect movie"
"Right now the audience score for Aquaman is neck and neck with Roma -- 78% and 76%. What does that say about audience tastes? Is that comparing apples and oranges? Yes and no. The two movies are totally different genres and must have limited audience crossover but they are both movies. I don't regret seeing Aquaman. It was fun. But the ocean in this movie isn't very deep. It is hard to find resonance with anything real that isn't pretty lame."
"Yes this movie had some fairly predictable plots and "meh" dialog. However I really enjoyed this movie not just because of Jason Mamoa's performance but just how visually beautiful it was. It had some of the best costumes and landscaping I've ever seen. I think James Wan knew what he was doing. To me this movie felt like a beautiful send up of the 1980s Saturday morning cartoon style I think it was boyish charming and just so radiant in colour and wit. you really do have to have the right mindset to see it though Don't take it too seriously"
"As good as the visuals are and as impeccable as the world building is the only enjoyment here is the first time you watch the movie. On second inspection the film does not hold up as that initial viewing did and makes you see that Aquaman is drowning in it own great moments."
"Again a familiar review saying the greatest visuals in a movie YET."
"Hello.Before beginning the analysis I must say that I am a beginner in this world of criticism of films "with humans".Do you like a fun movie full of surprising and frantic action scenes to the point of impressing the viewer at any time? It's the right movie for you. Do you prefer well-developed characters and a script that is minimally credible and does not abuse clich� (C)s? Wrong movie my dear.From the very beginning we have unprecedented destruction the film minimally tries to stop to introduce its characters in a way that provokes the affection of the public this simply occurs naturally with the course of the scenes. Think even the calm part of the introduction has several conflicts.Let's say at least we have some dialogues geared toward a basic introduction of what is happening and things to provoke the comic side (to the end) ... Other than that explosions.Arthur is by far the only character with a "mini-bow" of presentation as the narrative unfolds between flashbacks and present events; not to curl up since everyone has a sentimental connection to each other and only complements something for the public's understanding.The arc does not take much of the film which is good and does not arouse the boredom of the viewer moreover the performance is good enough to portray with skill the strong personality of the protagonist who although theoretically very generic can take advantage of the clich� (C)s in a good way and improve the reputation that the hero has here.I would say that despite using the clich� (C)s in a good way "Aquaman" abuses this.For example the relationship of our couple is totally superficial being moved and carried by a meager clich� (C)s of comedy and also conveniences of action. It can be said that "Amber Heard" does not shine or cause fascination because his character is very superficial which possibly hindered his performance (coloring the tedious is difficult). Mera is used as a convenient tool more than is used as a character."Arraia" demonstrates an interesting potential however it is forgotten and used in a confusing way being a simplistic opposition to the main objective and appearing at random as a script convenience. The matches are short (with tactics worthy of Power Rangers) and may rather disappoint the fans.In the meantime our antagonist is acceptable; the action reinforces well its ideals and brings to the fore that in the end it is not only an opposition to the others but yes someone who does not understand or accepts facts; being minimally humanized in its choices and slightly different from what we are accustomed to even though it is completely clich� (C) and having almost nonexistent development I believe that at least we have a potential for continuation.Other presences media have only the value of supplementing the narrative and do not necessarily give much emphasis to something nor do they sketch out prominence (with some exceptions in certain scenes). Still the cast is very generic simple and poorly developed.The script however far from being a wonder is very predictable and simple can impress. Because? Well most of the clich� (C)s are well used in addition the direction manages to catch the viewer in some moments although it can not be called primordial. The action however is quite convenient at times and there are yes many repetitive scenes to break the spectator's expectation but obviously few are caught by surprise (currently it would be more surprising if nothing happened).The script prolongs through unnecessary comedy the romance of the main couple only obviously to receive this in the end (in a moment of peace). Generic is relative however I would say that the movie is medium in this regard.Other than that the ending is a stereotype used positively. You can not count predictability as a grotesque mistake as we already knew that this premise of ideological battles would engender such a feat (even more so in a movie by an "independent" hero).However the film is filled with grotesque conveniences and occasional to the extreme misrepresenting (even) the sense of some things or generating flaws and holes.As has been said action is impressive and frenetic; now combine with the fundamental and beautiful design (the best part). Armor faithful to the HQ's without removing representative details (they do not look like a cosplay either which is great); everything is well detailed and immersive. The effects do not sin so much; soon they enter yes in the standard quality of films of heroes of the present time.The comedy of the movie is really bad if you are already accustomed to several movies of the genre since the jokes are only recycled from other works.Being direct "Aquaman" is incredible for those who seek to have fun or for those who praise heroism.Final grade? 5. Define well. Medium but fun."
"Aquaman was a great movie and arguably the the best dceu movie yet. My main problem with this movie is the writing this movie is filled with cheesy moments. But the MVP here is James wan. He covers up the writing with amazing visuals cinimatography and unique under water action sequences. So even though not the best movie I still HIGHLY recommend it"
"Enjoyed it. But severely flawed. But Jason Momoa made it all worth it. DC needs to stop with these all out CGI'd 'wars/battles' which are not adding anything to characters or the movie goer except an exasperated sigh Justice League v Steppenwolf was dragged out - too many tiny evil aliens dancing around the screen at all times. Atlantians v everybody else in the ocean �" too many small evil things crawling around. Just focus on developing your character in your first movie. Keep it small then move it up as the series progresses. I would rather have a single-man movie with Jason Momoa as Aquaman throwing jokes to a turtle on a beach for 2h 27m then seeing the Atlantians battle on CGI sharks in a war i have no emotional relation to because not even the main character was involved...so in one word. Bloated. But honestly i'd watch it again i'd even watch it 10 times just for Jason Momoa as Aquaman - perfection."
"#JasonMomoa... One great actor in my view! And sexy too! Found the intertexuality of medieval #KingArthur quite interesting although perhaps a bit more originality would have been better. The one thing that really brought my liking for the movie down was one: the entrance in the middle of the war on that humongous octopus/dinosaur is too much. Second the ending should have stopped with the closing narrative. All in all I enjoyed it 75%."
"Pleasantly funny DC movie though corny at times. A solid hero's journey for Aquaman while also expanding the DCEU to the waters!"
"I had a chance to see Aquaman early and I have to say this is the 2nd best DCEU film next to Wonder Woman. Its fun creative and action packed."
"It's not a great movie there are large holes in the plot. However it's a fun movie and Aquaman is ripped! :D"
"It may not be the best DC movie ever but it is still enjoyable and entertaining to watch Aquaman. It contains more laughs that previous DCEU movies. But why does it get so low rating by critics? Its stunning visuals doesn't help it to be even nominated for Academy award of best visual effects? Is it because it's a DC movie so it gets so much hate even it is actually a good movie?"
"Visually stunning and a easy story to follow up the event after Justice league"
"Aquaman is a very fun and hilarious ride I definitely recommend it!"
"If it weren� 1/2 1/2(TM)t for the visuals this movie would� 1/2 1/2(TM)ve been one of the worst movies ever made. The dialogue is laughable plot sluggish and characters all washed up. (Yeah I said it). DC hasn� 1/2 1/2(TM)t been close to the Marvel Universe and this movie is the furthest I� 1/2 1/2(TM)ve seen from it."
"Just perfect the most entertaining movie after infinity war!"
"Even if the story might not be perfect or is similar to yet another superhero film at least Aquaman has amazing action and shiny scenery as well as the chemistry of Aquaman and Mera. Very enjoyable indeed."
"Amazing acting special effects were on point."
"It was fun to watch. It had action and comedy with good special effects."
"good movie....expectations weren't met though...anyways kudos to you"
"Loves this movie! Cant wait for it to come out on DVD."
"Enjoyed the visual effects wished I'd have seen it in 3D"
"It was pretty but the dialogue stopped me from falling in love with this movie."
"Immensely overdone. Less CGI and more realistic looking backdrops would have sufficed. Extremely cheesy acting but entertaining for children of all ages. Not the best one-liners I've heard. Aquaman delivers (pizza)"
"THIS is what DC movies should have been."
"I watched Aquaman after a day was released in theaters. For me Aquaman is the best movie i've ever watched. As an action genre enthusiast I fell in love with this movie because there are many scenes with action combined with adventure. The storyline is very surprising and honestly until the middle i couldn't imagine how the ending of this movie. I think Aquaman is the best result of the collaboration of actors directors editors and many other parties involved in Aquaman's Production."
"When I heard the movie Aquaman was coming out in theaters first thing that came to my mind was a merman (half-human half-fish like a mermaid) superhero the fish-people would be talking with bubbles coming out of their mouth (in a cartoon-ish way). Few months ago I would�(TM)ve thought of that thinking that this movie would turn out to be ridiculous but those thoughts backfired on me. Maybe I�(TM)m being bias because I�(TM)ve always preferred Marvel rather than DC not that I hate DC Universe. Overall I enjoyed the movie sometimes I wish that this movie came out sooner before Aquaman made his debut in Batman v Superman."
"What a comeback for the DCU. Thoroughly enjoyed this action packed movie. There was rather a lot of stamping but definitely added to the tension and power of each character throughout the movie. Strongly recommend:)"
"An amazing film that has great character and affects it really capatures the great aspects of the dc universe. It� 1/2 1/2(TM)s a must sea for everyone not even just the superhero fans."
"Jason Momoa is baddass! The writing is pretty terrible but the movie is still fun to watch."
"While it certainly has storytelling flaws and another generic villain Aquaman is a vibrant film filled with some great action sequences that brings the DCEU back to life."
"Aqua-Thor is pretty good."
"For the past several months ever since I upgraded my tv to the so-called "ULTRA-HD" model I have increased my consumption of film and video programming. Most of you know that I rarely ever go to the theatre to see a movie. Its been at least several years since the last time I crossed the threshold into the popcorn scented spectacle of the multiplex.That being said I recently decided to push "pause" on this self imposed mediated exile in the hopes that through the enhanced imagery promised by technology I would see the appeal...more to the point...understand the import and meaning of the signs composed by those responsible: the "artists" who are represented by the aggregation of their genius the concretization in binary code of their concerted expertise as professional auteurs.In other words I hoped that in watching the most popular films of the past year the cinematic zeitgeist of our new millennium I would be able to participate in the all important negotiation of meaning that occurs between artist and audience. In simpler terms that I would understand popular culture's appeal and thus how it reflects the contemporary socio-cultural ontology that will define our aesthetic future as a species-being for perhaps centuries to come (think of the power of Shakespeare).Then I watched Aquamanheh.hahahahahahahahahhaaaaaaaaaaaaa....ahahahahahahahhahahahaaaaahhhahahahahahahahhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaa!heh...heh....heh...ok..whew...took a lot to write that comedy...i appreciate those of you who read it..."
"Fun and cute a good step for DC"
"Haven't even seen the movie just don't like Aquaman.Update: Saw the movie original score was accurate."
"the best superhero movie and best villain in S.H movie"
"Al fin una película de este universo que combina a la perfección la accion el guion los personajes y con un toque mas que notorio de el gran James Wan"
"Very good dc movies and one of the better ones really enjoyed it with a bit clich� 1/2 1/2 (C) moments but all round good."
"Really liked it ! fun  visually stunning . perfect holiday flick !"
"This movie was definitely the DCEU's best movies behind Wonder Woman. The plot lines of this movie are great and I think that Black Manta's origin was great and that he is definitely the best DC Villain so far. Momoa's acting as Authur Curry was great and his character is better than in Justice League. The CGI was great and the sets were great. I will say though the weak points in this film were definitely Amber Heard's acting and Patrick Wilson's acting. Wilson's character in general felt thrown off by the lack of emotion and motive in the Ocean Master. The comedy in this movie is a bit more forced and awkward because the DCEU has a darker tone than the MCU and the MCU has nailed humour because it is more natural. Despite this Aquaman had a few good laughs in it and It really lightened the mood. I give credit to the filmmakers for making the character of Aquaman work there are so many things that could have appeared campy or cheesy in particular the talking to fish ability but walking out of the theatre I wanted to see more of this be done. I have high hopes for the DCEU moving on if they can continue to create movies as good as Aquaman and hopefully bring it out of its dark shadowy pit."
"Such a good movie. The effects can be a bit iffy at time but the story and casting is amazing."
"7/10Too much water"
"A fun and ridiculous movie. Definitely cliche but that's what it's trying to be. It's nothing amazing and it's most certainly nothing special but they've successfully accomplished their goal at making an entertaining cliche stupid movie."
"Truly i am not a dc fan..bt movie is just awesome..i just love it"
"This was the worst movie I have seen in the last two years. The random screaming the poor graphics the nonsensical plot and the terrible acting add to a horrifically terrible movie."
"It is a comedy movie more than a superhero movie"
"Its non enjoyable i enjoyed few mins of the movie its not bad or good"
"It's a movie that relies on CGI. It works pretty well but the acting isn't the best."
"all the same always heroes ... go watch glass"
"Worst movie I've seen in a long time. And I love super hero movies. It made me question whether or not I still like movies. Turns out I do...just not this one. It's bad."
"Una pelicula con un guion trillado del superhroe clásico que en muchas veces tiene una actitud un poco tonta y sin sentido no existe una trama que quisiera descubrir en lo más de los 120 min de duración de la película.NO LA RECOMIENDO."
"A fun movie. A step in the right direction but still just your average superhero movie."
"Great movie.Stays true to the comic story line"
"Although the script is weak Aquaman still a fun popcorn superhero film with great visual effect and charismatic performance by Jason Momoa"
"Very poor script some very bad line delivery"
"Silly to a degree that's difficult to describe. I normally love all these type movies but this has to qualify as one of the worst. The special effects are ridiculous with so much happening it's nearly impossible to make it who's who. The constant pink and purple colors in the underwater scenes make it look like it was just thrown together in a hurry just to get it released. Sorry but save your money you'll be glad you did once you see it for free on a premium channel."
"The first half was good but then it turned into cheesy lines and long battles over and over. The animation was amazing but the story a little hard to follow. Worth an afternoon movie payment."
"Loved it. Not super fun but nice quality."
"So cheesy it stinks like Pont l'Eveque. I just watched 'Glass' and how the so called critics vote that below Aquaman (or even the overhyped cheese of Black Panther) is astonishingly astonishing. Now i can't even take the stink of Rotten Tomatoes seriously."
"how do people manage to write scripts this bad?"
"Such a good movie. Brings you into the life and struggles of aqua man.5 stars!!!"
"I loved it. DC is always working on improving their CGI. I went to see a DC movie and that's what I got. Expect cute funny and often corny lines. Jason Momoa is the best Aquaman."
"There are several problems with the continuity in the DCEU. It seems like all we learned from Atlantis in Justice League has to be forgotten. The leads have a lot of chemistry and the special effects are on point. However the script and dialogue deserved better."
"James wan fez um trabalho excepcional!!!"
"great movie Dc realy stepped up with this movie"
"For the life of me I cannot figure out how this movie is having the success that it is. I watch a lot of comic book films and this movie accomplished something I� 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)ve yet to experience up until now utter confusion. For the first part of this move I was confused on what was going on. Once I gained an understanding of the film the story was just bland and underwhelming. A villain was introduced to start of the film but has no impact on the film itself. You could have literally removed him from the film and had the same movie. I was trying not to fall asleep by the third act. Also was anyone else annoyed by the underwater dialogue? I had a hard time understanding the discussions that were occurring. The love story seemed forced but at least the two actors seemed to have chemistry. If I could compliment the film on one thing it would be the visuals. The underwater kingdom was amazing and quiet pleasant to look at.Overall the film was a disappointment."
"better than justice league"
"Fun and watchable but plagued by unending comparisons to better Marvel films that use the same plot points."
"best movie ever and better than mcu movies"
"A very good more Mythological than superhero movie. The superhero is very relatable and his quest is great. Co Stars William Dafoe Amber Haerd and Nicole Kidman where great too. The movie gives a great example over real problems. The sea and the land here to be united.Nice that Nicole Kidman and Amber Heard where not feminists in a wrong way in this movie."
"Good superhero movie especially for DC who's been hit or miss. Did run a bit long though. A fun time overall."
"This movie gave my brother a heart attack"
"Buena y entretenida pelicula buenos efectos y actuaciones lo que al fin necesitaba DC para levantar su Universo"
"I was bored. The CGI was great but the storyline was a cliched rehash."
"The latest entry into the beleaguered DC franchise has the feel as if DC were a broken down gambler in Reno down to their last chips and just decided: "Nevermind my previous losses. I'm bettin' it all!" That go-for-broke attitude powers this blindfolded dive into the deep end of the fantasy pool and there's no end of fun for that dive led by come-from-nowhere Jason Momoa who sinks his teeth into this like a puppy at his first barbeque. And they steal from practically everything sci-fi that came before. After a moment I gave up trying to follow all of the steals there's just that many of them: Blade Runner The Matrix The Wizard Of Oz Metropolis  Superman etc. etc. etc. just to get a big dopey fun movie! And what's wrong with that I ask you?"
"Best of DCEU very interesting directing and camera work (house fight & Sicily scene). Had a good fun"
"Aquaman was not a better character or plot/story than say Batman but.. there was something about *how* it was told that certainly evoked emotion. Indeed it was really a story about Aquaman's mum. Everything in it is about advancing the mother's story hardship and dedication over time. It has a intro middle (mostly hidden but always talked about as the focus) and conclusion. That story resonates as we think of our own mothers story. Another Aquaman story would completely miss that boat."
"I am in the minority on this one. I thought this movie was overly silly. It reminded me too much of Power Rangers from the 90's from my childhood. It didn't have any real moral story to tell. Great movies have good messages in them. I don't really think this was aiming at being a great movie. But even the "fun" stuff that people describe... I found dumb or cheesy. This was pretty close to the failings of Suicide Squad in my personal opinion when comparing it to the other EDCU movies. I was looking forward to this movie originally especially when I heard that James Wan was directing. But ultimately it was a letdown for me and my wife both. But she didn't have high hopes to begin with."
"Good flick!! You will want to take a piss before going in or bring a empty bottle -cause there is no pause in the action that would warrant leaving your seat!! Jason Momoa is perfect for this role!!! Reminded me why Auquaman was always my favorite super hero! Who cares about flying or laser eyes when you can literally communicate and control a Megladon or even the Kracken!!! Peacelove and hairgrease!! Never go by Profesional critics for some reason the movies they like usually suck!! Just my opinion....."
"No me gusto. Malos efectos visuales malas actuaciones  mal fotografia y mal manejo de dirección por parte de James wan. Mejor esta Batman y robin"
"Great from start to finish no real complaints."
"Why does this only have a 64 percent? I think this movie deserves better I enjoyed every minute of this film and it's my third favorite comic book movie of 2018. My favorite thing about this film is Black Manta he has a good reason to do what he did. If I had anything negative to say about it it would be on how Arthur becomes king. I mean you gotta see it from Orm's And the Atlantians perspective. Do you think that they would want this TOTAL STRANGER that just happened to show up and never even been there to be their new king? Other than that I love this movie it was a blast from start to finish and this is without a doubt the best DCEU film so farNumber rank 9.5/10Letter Rank A+??"
"The first half hour was very entertaining. When AMan hits the water however the constant barrage of special effects and noise had me stuffing napkins in my ears. I finally gave up. There was so much "action" (CG effects) and noise I talked out. If I want this much violence and BS I could watch CNN...."
"Serious some of the reviews are so lame of this movie. It's a good movie! The only thing I knock down is the massive battle before the final fight scene they serious have to learn to do these they just jump around from part to part and the battle ends up having no meaning at all. Marvel has the same issue with many of their movies. Anyway Excellent CGI good lead actors. Kidmann looks good but her acting is so so. Aquadude is seriously buff and his female accomplice is perfect for the part. The "Pirate" bad guy is ok just any angry revenge man I felt it really hard to care about him at all. The brother bad guy was good his supporting man who actually trains aquaman they never gave a smiling part to but his role was perfect for the movie. A great movie with an Excellent story. I'm afraid in my mind it ends with this movie for him but I see (SPOILER) they left a few villains ready to come back and do more carnage. Did I say EXCELLENT CGI?"
"Movie sucked sooo much"
"This is the best DC Movie since Wonder Woman but it was still not extraordinarily good. I liked the characters and the acting but the heavy CGI and unrealistic plot lead the movie to be above average. I recommend this movie to a audience no older than 21."
"Wasn�(TM)t expecting much from the actor but he did awesome wish all DC films were this good"
"For a DC movie it was outstanding for movie in general it was actually pretty good!"
"the acting was so bad!!"
"Aquaman is an excellent film. It is about Arthur Curry the human-born heir to the underwater kingdom of Atlantis who goes on a quest to prevent a war between the worlds of ocean and land. Jason Momoa and Amber Heard give fantastic performances. The screenplay is well written. James Wan did a great job directing this movie. I enjoyed watching this motion picture because of the action and adventure."
"Una de las mejores películas de superheroes tal vez solo por debajo de pantera negra"
"It was an awesome movie."
"Funny humour along with some cool moments but a lot of scenes that could have been paced better to make it seem less stupid."
"Better than I expected given the current history of DC Universe films. Ranks #2 behind Wonder Woman and quite a bit ahead of Batman v Superman and Justice League."
"That was one of the best movies I've seen. It was so different. The actors were also incredible <3 This and WW saved DC"
"It's good enough...to at least be a DC movie. Doesn't compare to Wonder Woman (2017) but it's enjoyable. Big complaint waaaaayyyy too much visual effects. And then the whole horror movie tie in toward act three just doesn't make sense. Overall it's a fun movie for the comic book geeks."
"When to see this movie stoned to be honest it was awesome but at some points I lost interest and started thinking about other stuff like how good the popcorn smelled and that I was really hungry but 8/10"
"Excellent movie great special effects and action."
"Finally a good DC film. Best one they have released yet."
"If Jason Momoa and Amber Heard weren't so charming this movie would be 0 stars from me. The dialogue and plot are among the worst in the DCEU and that's saying something."
"it was a repeat of many movies and heavily used cgi.at the end they used the exact ending scene from spider-man 1"who am i. i'm spiderman" "who am i. i'm aquaman""
"Extremely beautiful and entertaining movie."
"It's as if Starship Troopers and Power Rangers combined to make the longest movie ever."
"Really fun movie that was only missing a spark between Momoa and Heard. Family fun!"
"This was an enjoyable movie. Even though the back story was partially correct also Jason Momoa punched out crummy one liners he fits the role quite well after Aquaman joins JLA. My friends and i enjoyed the movie and liked the well done costumes and props."
"So awful it dragged and dragged & the actors kept pronouncing it as Arquaman & not Aquaman"
"Saw Aquaman last night I still think Jason Momoa was a terrible choice to play Aquaman. I thought action scenes were to blurry and to fast to watch. The underwater CGI looked liked like watching a blurry cartoon show. Acting wasn't that good. The final fight scene between Aquaman and Orm was just average for me not even close to mind blowing. One viewing for Aquaman for me."
"Enjoyable to say the least. It's a breath of fresh air for the DC franchise"
"long heartless undersea action with poor acting and clumsy CGI"
"The best DC film since Wonder Woman. Jason Momoa and Amber Heard are the best duo."
"the movie is very cool but have jokes nothing funny´s Patrick Wilson not is real villain in the movie but Jason Momoa is your regulate performance. The best of the movie are the visual effects. Is normal the movie but not is bad the movie in Hollywood and DC universe"
"This movie was boring and it� 1/2 1/2(TM)s trash don� 1/2 1/2(TM)t waste your money or time on it. It made no sense and dragged on."
"Finally DCEU has given a worthy superhero movie and the character Aquaman played by Jason Momoa is perfectly justifiable. I would rate 9/10 for it."
"Gestern im Kino gewesen. Hat mir exorbitant gut gefallen. Ich mag die DC-Filme um Längen mehr als den Marvel-Einheitsbrei und alles in einen Topf.Aquaman ist ein fest f� 1/4r Augen und Ohren. Ständig verdammt viel los auf der Leinwand. Synthie-Elektro Musik Bilder wie in Tron. Wird vorbestellt. Danke DC"
"Simply Awesome best Super Hero movie since Superman with Reeve."
"I really enjoyed this movie. It starts out and hooked me right away. And those fight scenes were amazing. I think this movie really put Aquaman on the map with great performances by the actors including Jason Momoa (who needs to be in more movies) Nicole Kidman Amber Heard and Willem Dafoe."
"Al parecer james wan cumplió lo prometido y dejó que ya no viramos a aquaman como un heroe ridiculo"
"Shows promise at times with visual similarities to Tron and LOTR but this is often trampled by the Sharkboy & Lavagirl level acting & plot."
"I think I'm getting tired of superheroes."
"Loved it!! Can� 1/2(TM)t wait for the sequel!"
"Just amazing. Aquaman..loved the series by wb but the movie was even better.The acting n effects were brilliant and i think the personality given to aquaman was right on target .its good to have a big of humour every now and again.The costume designs were amazing..it was all brilliant..i have no other words..Watch it if you havnt...you will be surprised. Great job by all the cast."
"Finally a better DCEU movie. This is one of the best besides Wonder Woman. It's extremely entertaining. Lots of action and humor."
"Its not perfect but it is a fun ride"
"Better than I thought it would be!"
"Aquaman is one of those movies that you just wanna see just to get out of the house. Its good but not great."
"Went into it knowing it was going to be a CGI popcorn flick ...barely made it through. It's the most predictable bits of every other DC movie wrapped up into one tedious forgettable burrito."
"Way more fun than I expected."
"Jesus this is a weak ass movie..."
"This to me was on par with the Thor series and was exactly what I hoped to see. Seeing the mythology around Atlantis coming to life was amazing!"
"a fun colourful joyride with a mediocre story and actors who really enjoyed being a part of it. The set pieces a diverse and beautiful and the creatures look just cool"
"Despite some Hard work on most people's part aqua man falls flat with explosions disrupting the best bits in the movie. With a pacing issue and a predictable twist Nothing could help this from being smashed critically but definitely an improvement in the dceu known for lackluster movies."
"64%? Worse than 'Black Panther'? No Oscar nominations? B*tch please!"
"Lots of fun!!! Jason Momoa made Aquaman cool! The acting was as good as any other superhero movie. The CGI is distracting at times but some of the visuals of the trench are breathtaking. My absolute favorite aspect of the movie was the action sequences! They were the best I have seen in a long time! Overall Aquaman is a movie that is pure entertainment. It does not have a deep message (pun intended) but still has rewatch ability."
"Great movie of the year by DC.. Everyone watch this movie. every moment great action superhero."
"Fantestic movie....every scene is enjoyable and lot of fun. massive sucess of dc. I LOVE IT. EVERYONE WATCH THIS MOVIE"
"it's okay but not great. Lots of directional and production mistakes. it is fun to watch but not good work."
"I immediately forgot the movie after leaving the theatre."
"It is not bad but not realisticbut the cgi is good to watch"
"Must watch this movie. If u don't watch Aquaman that means your year is wasted"
"Aquaman combines a cheesy visual story with non-stop action that feels like it goes on a little long with its 144 minute runtime. Amusing effort from DC to re-brand their name just make it a little shorter next time."
"Plot played a bit safe and it was a bit generic but the movie was good"
"My favourite movie in the DCEU so far.The CGI is awesome.Jason Momoa Amber Heard and Patrick Wilson play their roles brilliantly.The plot is good... enough.Some of the costumes look ridiculous.The movie is VERY predictable.It takes a while for the movie to find its ground but until then it is a very shaky ride.Overall really cool movie definitely recommend."
"Okay...So...Aquaman! That's all I can remember about a movie. If you like plot "You were born as a hero so you don't need to work hard to become one" you will like a movie. Overall; picture soundtracks costumes were good. I liked it but at the same time I disagree with making an Aquaman omnipotent and indestructible just because he is a mix of human and citizen of Atlantida."
"Never expected this after Justice league! If only DC could make more movies like this one..."
"A super fun experience not too serious but not too campy a great balance. My favorite of all the DCEU movies."
"Jason Mamoa�(TM)a performance wasn�(TM)t the worst part of this movie. Casting Patrick Wilson as Ocean Master was. One of the worst villains in recent superhero movies. Amber Heard played an uninspiring role as well. The Black Manta suit was just embarrassing and having the film set up a return of Manta doesn�(TM)t seem inspiring for the next installment of Aquaman. DC can�(TM)t seem to figure it out."
"Aquaman was the most anticipated movie of 2018 I was so scared to be bad or disappointing and fortunately it wasn't in fact it was great not perfect but still amazing.. so it's time to talk to u guys about this amazing movie so let's get into it!Aquaman is directed by James Wan his very first superhero movie screenplay by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick and Will Beall and starring Jason Momoa Amber Heard Willem Dafoe Patrick Wilson and Nicole Kidman.Story by Geoff Johns James Wan and will Beall... The film reveals the origin story of half-human half-Atlantean Arthur Curry and takes him on the journey of his lifetime--one that will not only force him to face who he really is but to discover if he is worthy of who he was born to be a king.This review will be spoiler-free because I don't want to ruin this movie to you guys...I really don't know where to start guys... Let's start with the direction.. James Wan's first superhero movie as its director is Aquaman so I was concerned to see him failing because we're used to see him mostly in horror movie like The Conjuring Universe Saw and Insidious.. so yeah I didn't expect him to make a great job with the direction in fact I was blown away of his amazing job with this movie especially with the action scenes he made every single scene epic and breathtaking thanks also goes to the crew of the CGI which I'm gonna talk about later on. James Wan did some mistakes with the direction as I predicted when I first heard that he will direct this movie he actually tried to make some jump-scares in this movie for no reason I don't get why.. let me tell you how... Most of the NORMAL scenes when people are talking or doing anything but fighting especially when they are in a house or somewhere closed they always ended with someone exploding the wall or anything unexpectedly just like horror movies and that's what I was afraid of! That's my only issue with the direction.Let's move to the flawless CGI!!!! Every scene of the underwater world was was well made by the CGI and the direction as I said above it's amazing.. I can't find any proper word to say about it.. it was fascinating i was super-entertained by how well done the CGI of this movie is!! They weren't afraid of making that much of Atlantis like Godzilla did I don't want to compare movies but Godzilla was too afraid to make that much of scenes of him but Aquaman took that risk and they nailed it!Also the performances were very talented by everyone Jason Momoa is amazing as Aquaman as he was in Justice League and maybe more! Amber Heard is badass as Mera... Patrick Wilson is an amazing villain and I loved him as King Orm and I can't wait to see him again in other DC movies!Let's move to my biggest flaw of this movie and it's a random choice.. I don't know but this might have some spoiler for you... There's a scene when Aquaman and Mera were fighting CREATURES in a boat and in this scene Arthur AKA Aquaman said a very random line that these creatures are from the bottom of the sea so they fear the light so he opens a random box to find a LIGHT SOURCE and he scares the creatures with it... This scene was so random the line of Aquaman can be forgiven but the random choice can't be!I tried to make it spoiler-free as I could and I highlighted some keywords which who watched the movie will understand what I'm talking about.So for those who want to know if Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse is better than Aquaman or not my opinion is yeah it's better than Aquaman but it also depends on what you want to see if you wanna see an epic old fashioned way superhero movie so Aquaman is your movie but if you wanna see a surprising and with a very powerful story so Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse is your movie. Anyways I really loved Aquaman and I'm gonna give it an A!Alright guys and thanks for reading my review and if you liked it you can click on my name up above to see all of my reviews. Look forward for my up coming reviews..."
"This movies is ok. However it has cheesy and at times bland humor the action is either really good or incredibly bad. The narrative is basic and overused. Finally Aquaman has a plot similar many other movies and design similar to others."
"The best movie of DCEU"
"Very fun lots of cool action sequences and lots of color and beautiful set peices. But the movie falls a little flat when it comes to the story and plot. It's all over the place at times and has problems pacing and keeping the audiance understanding what is going on at times. But definently should watch. Just and ok movie."
"Some areas of poor plot and dialogue is so cheesy in some areas it sounds like it was ripped directly out of a comic book. But when you go to a superhero movie the point is to have fun when watching it. Aquaman was funny action packed and truly for the fans."
"The writing of this movie is very hard to swallow. The actors and director try so hard to make it work but the jarring CGI and confused plot makes it a tiring film to watch. The romance is bland and though I see the vision they were going with Aquaman's character the goofy bright blond would have been more interesting to watch."
"Aquaman suppost to have short hair and slim"
"Its thor underwater seen it before. These movies are getn crap same old shit."
"Beats MARVEL at its production game... Its a must see and a game changer for DC"
"James Wan completely saved the DC EXTENDED UNIVERSEeven though I'm a fan of MCUbut this is the best of the best DC EXTENDED UNIVERSE movie that ever created"
"Me gusto la historia esta bastante entretenida los chistes creo que estsn bien no son forzosos y son en los momentos justos de la trama Audiovisalmente es exelente muy buenas tomas de camara como la peleas y prsecuciones en italia la pelea de la reina al ptincipio la toma de cuando Aquaman y mrra se van a las profundidades del oceano muy bien echa se siente como algo nuevo pero que no lo es y esta buena esa sensación o imprecion que da la pelicula la crtiticas negativas seria en su guión con altos y bajos y a esos crticos que dan por negativo todo se les podris decir que vuelvan a la fakultad a hacer devuelta sus estudios porque últimamente están poniendo criticas positivas a peliculas que son malas en muchos aspectos como que no saben hacer una critica de verdad y dan criticas negativas a peliculas que son buenas en muchos puntos o el crito de hoy no es serio y les pagan las empresas para decir cualquier barabasada con tal de venderse o no tienen idea de nada."
"very surprised i liked it as much as i did"
"Amazing animation but acting was shaft."
"Visually stunning with a decent story. It doesn� 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)t take itself seriously and is all the better for embracing its absurdity. Third act issues & some characters left to flounder (no pun intended) in the last act. But chemistry and charisma and general casting home runs make it the most fun I� 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)ve had in a movie in a really long time!!"
"REALLY ENJOYED ALL THE UNDERWATER SPECIAL EFFECTS AND ALL THE ACTION THAT TOOK PLACE WITHIN THE CITIES AROUND THE WORLD!"
"For being a DC comic movie I was highly impressed. Will be watching for a sequel."
"Had big hopes for this one but was severely disappointed"
"DC that� 1/2(TM)s how it� 1/2(TM)s done. No Batman with a gun crap. Destruction was world scale... again but it worked."
"Good specialeffects but the dialog was terrible"
"DC has such a rich catalog of exciting unique characters and it was refreshing to see Aquaman portrayed so well on the big screen. This felt nostalgic and new at the same time. Curry does a great job as the lead and the visual spectacle is dazzling in IMAX or any theater in general. Although it would have the occasional cheese-factor I expect to see a superhero film be a bit light-hearted from time to time."
"One of the most cheesiest and silliest comic book films ever made but James Wan and Jason Momoa embraces it�(TM)s childlike innocence and create an extremely scatterbrained and doltish movie which is essentially a Saturday morning cartoon with insanely brilliant visual effects: this movie is a ton of fun presenting a perfect blend of humour heart and thrills. Aquaman has always been seen as a irreverent character and his temperament has been heavily made fun of but now we have a film that showcases Arthur Curry�(TM)s real epicness and his badass nature. Holding the spotlight is Jason Momoa energetic and engaging performance as Aquaman who clearly cares about what he is making and combines his jokey self with the rest of the cast. James Wan impressive chemistry with the cast shines throughout the presentation as the whole cast give dignified performances. Amber Heard and Temuera Morrison gave terrific and underrated performances and Willem Dafoe makes do with his lack of material. The action sequences and cinematography looked awesome. The colours for the underwater world as well as the surface world boasted some vibrant and vigorous colours; the fights were very comprehensible and the open wide shots enabled the immersive experience there were some mind blowing continuous shots throughout the Black Manta action set piece. Forbye this film is frequently hilarious and the screenplay was filled with wit and memorable lines. Aside from that the script also withholds some very bad narrative issues. Black Manta felt shoehorned in and had no use to the plot and because he is such a great character saving him for the sequel would of honoured his arc but his first appearance was incredible and weighty. The Ocean Master was very uninteresting and cliche and some aspects of his role felt like a rehash of Killmonger from the Best Picture Oscar Nominee - Black Panther (especially his motivations for Atlantis). However Wan�(TM)s friendship with Patrick Wilson is enough to free the Ocean Master from oblivion. The story did feel unfocused at times but there are some outstanding scenes including the Tsunami segment where Mera is first introduced and some intentional but great jump-scary moments e.g. the boat scene with the fish monsters. So overall the film invariably saves itself persistently with outstanding action scenes and a compelling and crowd pleasing performance by leading man Jason Momoa."
"In a shocking turn of events DC Comics made a great movie that isn't about Batman! Finally with Aquaman fans get the type of movie they've always wanted from DC and I see big things for the future of this franchise. Arthur (Jason Momoa) is the son of the Queen of Atlantis and a mortal man. He was born with extraordinary abilities but not with the motivation to use them. After his mother was exiled and presumably killed by Atlantis Arthur wants nothing to do with his people until a world wide threat forces him to take action. The story here is the same as your basic comic themed film saving the world while trying to get the girl but what makes Aquaman really stand out is it's incredible special effects. Seeing as many films as I do it's difficult to impress me with a little bit of CGI but this film had some of the best effects I have ever seen! Even if this was a silent film the sheer beauty and magic of this underwater world would still be breath-taking. Jason Momoa stars in his biggest role to date and this guy absolutely killed it. My biggest fear going into this film was that it would be too cartoonish and led by a newcomer not a great combination but Momoa is terrific both his personality and in his ability to put on one hell of a fight scene. As for the cartoonish part there is a little bit of that and it was a turn off but you do need to pander to the young crowd a film like this is likely to draw. For my money this is the best DC Comics film since the Dark Knight. I'm not the biggest Superhero fan and I absolutely loved this movie from beginning to end. The two and half hours literally flew by and in the end I was still craving more. I can't wait to see what's next for Aquaman."
"This movie seems to be the answer to the question: what film would Jason Momoa have the most fun humanly possible making?While slightly long Aquaman is every bit of superhero cheesiness CGI glory and action packed fun that a supehero genre fan wants from a movie. Most importantly it's hard not to enjoy a movie that was clearly made with glee."
"I went into Aquaman with no expectations and I left the cinema not feeling satisfied or dissapointed. Although this is a step in the right direction for the DCEU it's still baby steps as the universe still tries to find its feet."
"Thanks to hard work and great Visual effects James Wan was able to tell a "from Zero to Hero" story for Aquaman"
"good movie"
"A very good movie that can put the DCEU back on the map. The CGI was outstanding and the mixture of practical and special effects ( the Aquaman and Black Manta suits were actually real ) gave the movie a nice twist. The only negative I can think about was the relationship build up between Aquaman and Mera that felt very cliche and forced."
"Totally worth your money and time!! Visual blast and spectacular action after a long while in 2018"
"Exceptional visuals combined with a fine story. Absolutely worth watching in theatres."
"this movie is great if you accept it for what is yes its cheesy at parts and a little bit ( who are we kidding a lot ) over the top but if you embrace that it really is a fun and entertaining movie. the part of the movie seems fast and forced but after that its a lot of fun.the CGI is crazy good and come on there f****** labor sharks. I would highly recommend this movie."
"Aquaman Positives-the characters are great! Especially Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Black Manta. He's a cool villain.-The fights are amazing (the final battle is so epic and grand)-Some very charming and humorous scenes (especially one involving a rose)-Soundtrack (minus Pitbull) is good-some very neat looking creaturesNegatives-too much exposition-very long-lots of CGI (I don't hate CGI but if you do this ain't the movie for you)Overall a very fun movie."
"Aquaman is a blast! James Wan knocks it out of the park and crafts a movie that is part superhero flick part Excalibur part Lord of the Rings and part Star Wars. The action is top notch as the fights and battles get bigger and bigger in scale. Jason Momoa is badass as he is funny as Arthur/Aquaman. Amber Heard play the strong but also charming Mera who has some great chemistry on screen with Momoa. Patrick Wilson and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II are great as the villains who are so sinister but have their reason for what they do. The movie is about lineage and rising to destiny to defend against corruption and destruction. Overall it is an epic movie."
"A geat movie! Very touching and emotional mixed with great visuals and action. I felt hype watching this couldnt ask for anything more. Definetly recommend you watch it and see how you like it!"
"As bloated excessive and overlong as it is "Aquaman" is tons of flashy and campy fun that shows at least some promise for future DC installments."
"Good effects same old story."
"Though it's nothing new and plot lines can clearly be seen as done before and much better Aquaman makes up in incredible visuals and a fun turn by Mamoa. The one who I find steals the show though is heard as her take of princess mara is captivating and strong something greatly missing. Black manta I found to be a useless villian Wilson can't take on a leading villian. Would have loved to see more social commentary that they attempt early on but never use to its potential. Still fun movie to watch that you just turn the brain off"
"Well to start off I loved this movie. Maybe not as good as Wonder Woman but still great. It�(TM)s cheesy but that�(TM)s just part of what makes it great. It�(TM)s funny and fast paced and very interesting. Great acting from everyone and some nice character arcs. I would highly recommend all DC fans see it."
"I did not enjoy it as much as the critics.It's loud.It's obnoxious.And there's a lot of superman-style holding of grandiose poses.It's not a horrible movie but it's also overly long.The scene with the crab creatures is completely unnecessary. The battle lines have already been drawn. The bad guys don't need to add the crab people to their side. This just adds 20 minutes of extra/wasted viewing.There's other things I can pick on but that sort of is the gist of it."
"Enjoyed it a lot not a huge Aquaman fan but this managed to win me over. I know he's not 100% like the Arthur from the Comics but that's kinda why I like him. He's less of a Boyscout now. The plot is pretty typical of adventure films like Indiana Jones theres a macguffin that will win the day for Evil or Good. Pretty normal right? Well the visuals and the acting have elevated the normality of these cliche tropes. I mean these visuals really impressed me Atlantis was so beautiful. My weakest elements come down to some casting decisions and some effect-shots look pretty bad. Any scene with Nicole Kidman just looks so green-screeny around her. Same with the father but those are very small issues. Most effects shots are actually quite superb. Whoever worked their ass off on the water effects needs a pat on the back because there a lot of shots in this movie that look absolutely stunning because of the water. The final fight with Ocean Master is the best example all of that must've taken months of rendering and it was worth it! Overall this is the best DC film they've put out since trying to compete with Marvel if they can keep this up with every other adaptation we might be seeing a revival of DC."
"It was like Star Wars underwater. The visuals used in this movie were incredible! I really liked Ocean Master he is my new favorite villain. The story was really cool too."
"Meh. It looks really good from a VFX standpoint and it has interesting locations. But from a story standpoint there are some big problems. The writers crammed WAY to much into this movie. They literally shoved so much in this film to lead it to a sequel. Its watchable but it ends there. I swear they kept using the gimmick of an explosion (mid conversation) to start a battle like 5 times. That really ticked me off."
"Es una de las mejores peliculas de superheroes aunque a MARVEL Tomatoes le duela"
"Aquaman is one of the better products of the DCEU. An overall enjoyable film with stunning visuals and a great score to accompany it. Cheesy dialogue and a so-so plot dampen the movie as a whole but still a step in the right direction for the DCEU who desperately needs a win."
"Fresh funny full of action"
"A vast change of tone from the normal DCEU we're used to in a good way. Jason Momoa did a great performance. I hope the DCEU continues with this more colrful tone as this is now standing right beside Wonder Woman as my favourite DCEU film. Only criticism is Black Manta looked awesome but he was defeated too early on because you forget about him by the post credit scene. I think it would've been better if Black Manta was left for a sequel as we have no idea how he came to be in aliance with Orum"
"Mamoa and Heard were fantastic. The action was fun and I thought they did a great job finally bringing this character to the big screen in a way that made it relatable."
"Directing was good. Wan was a good call particularly for making the Trench frightening. Plot was fairly standard paint-by-the-numbers. A lot of the acting was fantastic -- it was funny to see comic book movie alumni Dafoe Kidman and Wilson return to 4 color theatrics. The score was annoying and distracting -- abysmal."
"Great Movie has everything you want on a superhero movie this is the resurgence of the DCEU"
"A fun look into the city of Atlantis but some scenes have a hard time making it feel like im not watching rough CGI. Jason Momoa does a valiant job in his performance saving this film for me. 7/10"
"Aguaman falls short of anything out of the ordinary with a daft storyline leaving the audience disappointed and wanting more."
"Shouldn't their voices gurgle under water?"
"Movie was very predictable. Though overall positive. I am giving a 3 outta pity tbh. 2.5 might be more fitting but I want DC to succeed and this is a good direction to go."
"he rides a seahorse..."
"Fantastic ride great graphics Kidman was good  mamoa was good story was fun and energetic. Welcome back DC from a marvel fan glad you got your stuff together finally."
"This had a lot of action however the digital animation was way over the top and so was the mythical creatures that we are supposed to believe beneath our oceans.."
"One of the best movies I have ever seen. It was a mix between everything a movie needed to be a great movie. I mean just a thumbs up from me."
"Jason Momoa has easily got to be the most engaging action hero of 2019...I guess the comedies like Family Guy & Simpsons and Robot Chicken are feeling pretty stupid for all of their jokes about how lame Aquaman is right about now... Aquaman WAS not supposed to be cool... this WAS SO FKN COOL!!!The movie is totally Epic 10/10! Bigger & Better than Black Panther & Wonder Woman & crazier than Wolverine combined!The DC Universe have smashed it out of the park! It really felt like they had a 3 movie plan and just said- "..screw it ALL IN!"Amber Heard was smoking and Dolph Lundgren Patrick Wilson Temuera Morrison Nicole Kidman all slayed.James Wan take a bow... in an era of Logan Infinity War Deadpool and Black Panther... Aquaman stood VERY TALL!"
"Shiny flashy garbage.I have never seen the movie spend so little time on character development but still managed to be so insufferable along. For example all I know about the princess he's that she has red hair and perfect breasts."
"This is a drive-in movie if there ever was one. Alas there are no more drive-ins. This is CGI feast that knows its gone over the top and it doesn't care. Jason Momoa and an able cast do their best to ground it all in something akin to human feelings. It could have been more but as a popcorn movie its something of an extravaganza."
"Hardly any political nonsense. Was refreshing."
"Good God! This movie...THIS MOVIE! It is absolutely 100% bonkers ...and that's why I like it so much. This movie doesn't try to explain any of the ridiculous things that happen. Stuff happens and it's ridiculous. But it's a good kind of ridiculous. It's a movie that really understands what it's trying to be. It's complete nonsense but it's fun nonsense. There were times when I genuinely laughed out loud and this isn't even a comedy (although it kind of is in a way) I said "whoa" out loud. I'll be honest I've never actually said "whoa" out loud not in a theater. 4/5"
"Can someone please tell me why people like this movie? It's basically Batman v Superman but with a few jokes added in. This really was ridiculous. Luckily Captain Marvel is around the corner!"
"Really fun movie. We had a blast! Great visual effects!"
"Dexter: Entertaining and beautiful visuals. Gabby: Best out of the DC movies lately but still not up to par with Marvel."
"The movie should be nominated for worst script ever."
"After quite a few bad movies (cough cough batman vs Superman cough cough Justice League) the DCEU has finally offered a decent movie. Although there are a few things that make Aquaman a little cheesy Aquaman has strong characters and an interesting plot. I am very excited to see Aquaman in future DC movies."
"Ive seen alot of movies where im consistently rolling my eyes at some cringey moments. Aquaman is by far one of the corniest and most generic (superhero) films I have seen in a LONG time. I wanted this film to be good prior to watching it and when I heard the good reviews pouring in I was excited. I get to the theatre ready to walk out of this film 45 minutes in. A generic plot terrible acting awful one liners. Im disappointed in some of the actors such as Willem Dafoe and Nicole Kidman because they are great but they just seemed to be so over the top cheesy in this movie. I would have enjoyed this movie at 6 years old. I cant see how anyone older than 13 gave this good reviews. Would not watch again."
"Surprisingly uninspiring. The movie is an overly long video game with forced humor and too few interesting scenes."
"The Movie is great fun for people who love the comics. I think that it exhibits the best of what CGI can do and I think it also has relate-able and fun characters."
"Aquaman is a just okay movie. It definitely does not stand out when compared against the plethora of superhero movies. It follows the classic superhero or really any hero origin story plotline. You guessed it The Hero's Journey. It is rather predictable with very few twists or surprises in the plotline. Along with Aquaman the Black Manta is also introduced. He is a pretty interesting and complex character but two-thirds into the movie he he retreats licks his wounds and just disappears with little resolution. There is no explanation for why Aquaman is able to communicate with the sea creatures and Mera is able to control water better than the other Atlanteans. Also it is a little to lovey-dovey for a superhero movie as there is even a kissing scene in the middle of the main fight sequence. However I will give the animators credit for some of the very beautiful underwater scenes."
"Loved this movie - best of the DC movies. If you never see another Superhero movie you definitely need to see this one."
"I have very low expectation coming in for this movie. Hell it blew my eyes. The visual was amazing. Remind me of the Avatar. The movie is on par with Wonder Woman. DC really should have started out with an origin story first. How I wish they can redo the whole Justice League again."
"I wouldent watch this superhero movies go to far. its all gone too far"
"Terrible. Tried to do too much in 1 movie and it was a mess. Maybe would have been better if it was 3 separate movies. CGI was great. Maybe watch it without sound."
"Probably another copy and paste version of another horrible Marvel movie and this time it happens underwater."
"Total waste of time! A movie made for gathering money."
"All good action packed and beautiful. Jason Momoa is great as Arthur Curry and really liked the Black Manta character. Would think that the movie would be better with just him as a villain as it was packed with people now. Best delivered movie from the DCEU."
"BAD not really interesting or well developed plot. cgi fx sometimes are superb sometimes are totally bad. at the end of the day he is the king cause of the trident and not cause of his values.ridiculous movie. stay away from it."
"Generic but fun. Weirdly paced there are several moments where exposition is cut off by an explosion that makes me think the film is directly making a point which is funny and all though it also disallows character moments. By character moments I mean real insight into how characters are aside from fast-paced transitional banter between and during fight scenes. I never really care about text appearing on the screen telling the audience where a scene is though I thought it was pretty unnecessary for the text to appear detailing that Arthur and Mera were entering the "trench" or whatever since it was pretty obvious. Not much else to comment on except the visuals which looked good."
"Jason Mamoa is best when he acts as himself on screen. This Arthur is very fun loving and mischievous with a deep sense of loyalty. Think Ronon Dex but no guns. The movie is a lot of fun with enough easter eggs for your DC fanboys. Hey when they start off with Lovecraft early in the movie you know they are trying to make up for first two DCEU movies. Don't expect too much and you'll have a great time."
"Was it written by a 6th grader? Awful!! 1/10"
"top film off the year yes im including avengers"
"It was as it should be a lot of fun!!!"
"Completely goofy and plain awesome fun."
"Silly unfunny but surprisingly mildly entertaining"
"The dialogue is terrible at times and the acting is "meh" for the most part. All that being said it's still a jaw-dropping must watch film. The visuals are so stunning that at times it saves the movie at other times it adds to the greatness I'm witnessing on screen. A great win for DC with the best movie in their extend universe so far."
"Second best DC movie after Wonder Woman"
"Visually stunning with a great cast. Wilson Mamoa Heard and Kidman's performances were brilliant. The physicality and charisma onscreen of Mamoa's Aquaman over powered both the visage and essence of his half brother; although Wilson's characterization and skills are affable."
"It's too simple to say that one can draw inspiration from this movie. Instead it's more... real to say it is a relate-able adventure of a man who will be king in the hero in all of us. Aquaman is hand-down the best/most recent DC movie thus far. Go see it!!!!"
"Gostei muito pois alem de um visual deslumbrante mostra uma historia boa fiel aoa quadrinhos e com efeitos especiais muitos bons mesmo e gostei de todos os desemvolvimentos dos personagens  só queria mais do Arraia mas certeza que em um proximo filme vão explorar mais"
"Aquaman has some amazing characters and great visuals.But the plot is just stupid and script is terrible. 5/10"
"Download This Movie FUll HD"
"Marvel movies have discovered the formula for a solid action flick. That's why it's fun to watch DC's attempts. They don't have everything figured out yet and because of this every DC attempt has the potential to be thrilling or a dud.. This movie just so happens to be the former."
"Few plot holes but didn�(TM)t take away from my enjoyment  best dceu film by far"
"Average which for D.C is above average"
"This movie pleasantly surprised me. Just a really fun and enjoyable watch. Yes it had corny dialogue but it�(TM)s a film about a guy who can talk to fish what did you expect."
"James Wan delivers but the silly plot and some leading roles' acting is unbearable."
"Jason Mamoa� 1/2(TM)s acting was not that entertaining. The storyline is better than most DC movies but got a little bit too wild at the end for me. Also the costumes were extremely cheesy in my opinion and the movie seem to drag on near the end. Go watch to get your super hero fix while you wait for the Marvel movies in the spring."
"Holy smokes!!!! This was the best superhero film since The Dark Knight and I've liked most of them. DC Marvel or otherwise."
"Big cheesy adrenaline-fueled fun. The dialogue and some of the acting is very cheesy but the crazy action beautiful set-pieces and Jason Momoa make this movie a joy to watch."
"In my opinion it� 1/2 1/2(TM)s quite a mess. Trash and cringe scenes from the very beginning the soundtrack is awful (never heard and thought possible that such a shameful cover of Toto� 1/2 1/2(TM)s Africa could exist) characters don� 1/2 1/2(TM)t have an evoulution throughout the movie costumes are ridiculous (and are the demonstration that comic books accuracy does not alway works well on a live action movie). Even though the visuals are evocative to me (maybe it was only my problem) green screens were quite � 1/2 1/2noticeable� 1/2 1/2� 1/2?. As Italian from the south of the country I truly hated the stereotypical representation this movie offers. The only few links with previous movies create problems in terms of continuity. In the end the only elements I truly appreciated were a scene filled with an horror vibe and another one involving Mera. This movie does not hold a candle to Wonder Woman that still remains the best movie of this disastrous shared universe."
"A flat out adrenaline rush from start to finish with jaw dropping special effects likable characters and strong direction form Wan."
"It has some story issues but it is a very entertaining movie. Jason Momoa perfectly fits the role of Aquaman."
"A movie where the suspension of disbelief is necessary. Good performances and excellent cgi. A great popcorn movie."
"Probably the greatest CGI based movie since Avatar although the story was made slightly different with the comic."
"My man DC is back on track. it's the best DCEU movie till now and one of the best 3D movie after Avatar."
"my eyes didn't even blink!"
"fantastic production. Never a dull moment. Had to suspend disbelief a little but it wasn't hard. Good mix of many elements."
"Great moviebut I wish it was different in the way that every time something important happens it would be interrupted by a explosion just when it capsized comes to it. It is predictable. But it did make aqua man look better after his last movie"
"This movie was released in China and Europe first so the Marvel bought critics could not trach this DC movie like they have done in so many other. Critics must be made accountable and stop taking bribes and be honest when they give an opinion."
"Doesn't hold a candle to Wonder Woman but tall-buildings worth of leaps (and bounds) better than everything else that's come out of the DCIThoughtSheWasWithU. It's weirdly kind of... The nicest? Of these movies? Which is not the kind of direction you would think a film in this series would go based on how it started but Jason Momoa is just charismatic as Hell and Aquaman leans on that a lot.By the time it's over Aquaman really does hit just about every cliche of the genre there is which is not exactly high praise. It's certainly not without heart but it is still more spectacle than substance. But unlike say your Transformers 4 a movie often levelled the same criticism it is not trash."
"5 minute cool submarine rescue then two hours of CGI garbage"
"Saw it in a great theatre. AMC dine in or something like that. Music and sounds were awesome. The CGI was awesome. Didn't feel like I was lost in the fight sequences. The story was awesome and had great comic relief. Felt that the acting was A+."
"An absolutely fantastic movie. A reference to others to come. and I sincerely hope that many more will come."
"a fantastic movie. Aquaman brilliantly by momoa a film that presents itself in an innovative way for the oldest fan and exceptionally for the youngest in the geek world."
"Good enough what you are expecting JM does a fair job of acting and Nicole Kidman was even better. The underwater effects are pretty amazing."
"Entertaining popcorn fare."
"Quite average.James Wan and the star cast (Jason Mamoa Amber Heard Willam Dafoe and Patrick Wilson) turn a bland and horrendous script filled with exposition dumps and unnatural dialogue into a fun filled movie that hits the high notes and drags on the low notes but also has enough charisma and style to make it passable."
"Aquaman was a fantastic action film and a visual spectacle.It was however marred by a forced romance plot and incredibly cheesy one liners. Even so worth a watch."
"Although coming from a studio that has squatted down and taken a fat dump in our faces with all it's recent movies Aquaman is undeniably fun to watch. The fight scenes and CGI all look amazing and the overall comic booky-ness is very entertaining. There are a few turds here and there though. The scene on the pier at the start looks straight out of The Outsiders Nicole Kidman seemed to not give a shit about her character and the dialogue and "jokes" were fucking abysmal. It really is saved by it's entertaining fight scenes and world building and I can't stress enough how well they do in that department. Overall it gets a 60 from me."
"It's as if director James Wan said "This is Aquaman this is a comic book film. Fuck you! We're making a big fun crazy bonkers fantasy epic! It should be crazy! Whether you like it or not we don't give a fuck!" And I respect the hell out of him for it.Is the plot predictable and by-the-numbers? Sure. Were there some cringe-worthy lines here and there? Sure. Is the film overblown and overlong to a fault? Sure. Were the music choices really odd? Sure. But everyone makes it work because they know what kind of weird film they're making. Not a flawless film by any means but it is a damn fun time. See this event on the big screen! It's not to be missed."
"Wear comfy clothes this movie is a little too long."
"Tremendous special effects combined with a stellar cast and a movie that truly feels like a comic book results in a very fun movie."
"Roteiro confuso visuais exagerados e falta de criatividade são três palavras que definem o filme. Pode at� (C) divertir algumas pessoas mas no meu caso só achei fraco."
"Must see more than once kinda movie..."
"I went in thinking it was going to be horrible but instead I loved it. Please give it a shot its worth it."
