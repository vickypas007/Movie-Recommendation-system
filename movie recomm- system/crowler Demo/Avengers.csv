"Avenger Infinity war part one is undoubtly MCU biggest and extravegent thrilling film since Avengers. Avengers: Infinity war is very ambitious with its dazzling visuals and its emotional finale. All the cast was great and their performance was intriguing entertaining:especially Chris Evens Scarlett Johasson Robert Downey Jr Tom Holland Elizabeth Olsen Chris Pratt Dave BatistaZoe Saldana Chris Hemsworth and Josh Brolin as (Thanos.) The plot was excellent it was very close to the comics so it did justice in that department. Although Infinity war had its share of comedic entertaining feel it also had a dark tone to it which we don't see a lot in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Overall Avengers: Infinity War prt one was a emotional dark entertaining fun rollercoaster. I highly recommand this film for any MCU fans."
"O MELHOR FILME DA MARVEL JA FEITO ATï¿½ HOJE !"
"Most Messed Up Cliff Hanger Ever in a Movie in this Decade. Which is a good thing. Marvel have strung along characters and balanced them well. The only negative being Captain America and the gang having a short screen time."
"I love the fast pacing of this movie. It makes us believe in the urgency of the problem. Spider-man's death though.... it's heartbreaking"
"enjoyed every bit of the movie  i am a marvel fan since ever so an avengers movie would only feed my geekdom"
"why they didn't just teleport cut the hand off :| a bit dull movie.But it is saved by Thanos !!!"
"The best Marvel movie so far can't wait for End game"
"This movie is definitely the best Avengers movie in the franchise. It has a great plot and action sequences and I would definitely recommend it."
"Awesome movie one of my favorites from Marvel!"
"Half a movie shit plot blatantly obvious comic book fails and ever moment in the film too perfect for words change one thing slightly and the plot falls apart like a house of cards. Blech."
"This film is too much too soon. Even with 10 years and 19 films to prepare Infinity War feels rushed with too much happening and too many characters to service. There are several heroes who have little to nothing to do and who's absence would not affect the film in any way and unfortunately this includes some of the MCU's most iconic characters. This is exacerbated by the detail placed on the films villain Thanos. Thanos is a great addition who has his origins motivation and true power all introduced into the movie. Unfortunately whilst these are some of the strongest moments in the film it gives even less time to the heroes and more specifically the titular team the Avengers. This film should have been restructured as a Thanos film and once he is introduced then a follow up Avengers film one which focuses on the heroes not on Thanos. The CGI in this film also ranges from good to awful but I never found myself saying wow. The opening scene shows Thanos and his minions and the CGI on the minions threw me out of the film immediately it was just bad. The CGI on certain heroes also looked bad. For example Iron Man's suit looks worse than in his debut solo film 10 years ago how can this be? There is an overabundance of CGI as most of the film relies on action over story. There are too many actions scenes which have funny looking CGI people fighting other funny looking CGI people and this is all made worse by the choppiness of the filming. The film insists on cutting to another angle everyone and a half seconds and this is not a problem limited to Infinity War but it has been used in the MCU for far too long now. Where are the Daredevil-esque one shot fight scenes?The humour has long been a problem for me as well. Humour works in comic book movies it adds light to a genre that could otherwise be so dark and gloomy however with so many forced child friendly jokes this film (again along with the rest of the MCU) feels too light for the gravity of this world ending situation. The odd joke or two would not go amiss but it just takes the humour too far. Ultimately with little story too many characters and poor CGI this film was a disappointment and not worth the wait. It far from gets me excited for the next Avengers film. Instead I'm left wondering if I'll even bother going to see the next film in the cinema or just wait for a Blu Ray release. It has really hit home that I am tired of the same formula humour and action which has become expected of the MCU and this film sums up my boredom with the franchise. It needs to spread its wings a bit and go for something different."
"It's a good movie it delivers what it promises but it's not all that is said to be."
"The movie that might be Kevin Feige's magnum opus."
"definitely a great movie tied with 'Roma' as my favourite film of 2018. Would probably be extremely confusing for those who haven't watched any of the other MCU films though."
"Action packed and fun the whole way through with its scalenumber of characters and amount of action this is the best this movie could have been"
"One of the best Marvel Cinematic Universe movies so far!"
"One of the MCU'S BEST!!! Great way to mix almost all of the superheros together with a very sad ending leading up too 2019's Avengers 4!!! Very Job Well Done!!!"
"The movie which every comics fan in the world expected to see and it is here. The CGI from this movie was the thing that more impressed me more than the Doctor Strange's movie one. Something that perturbed me was the coincidences like Peter Parker (Tom Holland) passing on the school trip bus at the exact moment that the Black Order space-shift was arriving on Earth. Or the Thor body being encountered for the Guardians that was the only ones who attended to the Asgardian 911. But at the final at the conclusion a great history that took 10 years for writing finished with the defeated Earth's Mightest Heroes."
"If you like superhero movies this is your kind of jam. Epic awesome and tragic. Very well done"
"TAN TAN TA TA TAN TAA N TA MNBH"
"Best movie of all time"
"Most of the movie is 2.5 stars and in some moments I was thinking in 3 stars by the effort of crossover and some aspects of maturity but (SPOILER) it gets too far in cruelty and I put 2 stars because the devastating end: I would prefer that in the people killed by Thanos the script writer who works for him had been killed too. Of course I presume new sequels will explain in a (hopefully) credible way why Dr. Strange has played an unexplanaible role but it will not compensate the fact that Starlord and Thor acted as stupids and that I would not ask Avengers for help even for a grannie to cross the street according to their rate of success. As I say I presume this situation will get solved in future sequels but very good has to be the solution not to think this was a bad trick to play with us (yeah it is an original end but too cruel and very stupid if if finally gets solved). I hope they find better solution in future movies that explain what has happened. In any case I really want to put this movie a 2 stars because it let me disappointed from cinema (playing with us until last minute with the decision about if this was the real end or not; you can have a bad ending because situation requires it even making us feel bad but playing with us and our hope... for that we have real life)."
"Infinity War truly felt like a perfect movie"
"Holy shit wow what a movie that had some very serious consequences well done villain is amazing the heroes are badass and last but not least it did well bringing everyone together in one big spectacle"
"truly revolutionary film"
"This movie entertained me! Epic battles I laughed cried was impressed with the CGI decent story (doesn't hurt that a decade of buildup helped with that). One of the best MCU flicks."
"The age of bad films."
"We're not gonna lie we all know what's gonna happen. They are gonna bring all the characters back. Even before when we got the Guardian of the Galaxy three and Spider-Man Far From Home confirmation. Would have to recommend it to anyone who has seen the last films also wasn't too gory. The acting was very good and Josh Brolin was a very good choice. Also he was a good CGI actor. The soundtrack was incredible and added a lot in scenes. The way they used the infinity stones was unimaginable. Luckily we got to see what the reality stone was capable off since we didn't get anything from Thor: Dark World. Thanos was probably the best CGI thing I have ever seen. I was very surprised with the twist of Red Skull is alive the whole time since Captain America: The First Avengers.We have definitely seen the Russo Brothers work with more than two superheroes but it was interesting to see them use more than two villains. And it was a great choice to use the order well that's what I believe its called. Also its the biggest combination of superheroes in a film. CGI was extremely good and the detail with the gauntlet was incredible. Especially since there are many uses for it. One of the biggest flaws is that there are too many ways to stop Thanos they may have said that there was only one way but that was just there to stop fans from saying "it was so easy to defeat him". Josh Brolin did a great job.Overall I won't be surprised if the film gets an award for visual effects in the Oscars. I loved to see all the characters go full out with their abilities. I enjoyed the female Avengers teaming up. The big army in the film was quite spooky.Grade: A-"
"This is a good movie in general but I have a few complaints first off this movie makes you watch about 19 movies to fully understand what is happening. Second the movie had a very hard to follow plot. The sons of Thanos added absolutely nothing to the overall story. Other than that I liked seeing all of my favorite marvel characters come together in an epic battle of proportions to fight against Thanos."
"Thanos wiped half of human population including our beloved Avengers heroes i don't blame him though if only he choose only the bad one such as criminals or whatever but no he also make spider-man and Doctor Strange to name a few to disappear too *sigh*."
"very well done they took SO many risks and actually riveted the audience! They packed SO much into just one movie I don't know how they did it"
"Not only was this movie greatly made and perfectly executed it shows the benefits of waiting and being patient with character development plots and script. The movie has so much success that the voice of the haters who want act like if they such a higher state of consciousness when it comes to understanding movies when really they just want someone to say ï¿½ 1/2 Wow youï¿½ 1/2(TM)re smart ï¿½ 1/2 are at a volume so low that theyï¿½ 1/2(TM)re 100% irrelevant."
"By far my favourite MCU film with the great balance of action and comedy as well as living up to the 10 years building up the encounters we've been waiting for: Doctor Strange and Tony Stark Guardians and Avengers and obviously the showdown with the mad titan. A must see to all superhero comic book movie fans. All actors did a stellar performance! Love this film"
"The long awaited MCU film is finally here and it doesn't disappoint. But it is a muddle. One of the best Marvel Cinematic Universe to date but isn't a epic as Civil War"
"I Love how Marvel let all these 10 years worth of hero's balance the screen. This movie is probably Marvels best. Can't wait for Endgame!"
"It's a movie that you have to see as one of the greatest MCU movies I have seen and really enjoyed in the movies and really did good for the ending and waiting of what happens for next sequel End Game"
"This movie is amazing!!!! It has a good balance bouncing between the different characters in different places ultimately bring all these characters to 2 locations. The balance between action and movie is fantastic!"
"This movie gets better every time I watch it. The actors are amazing but Josh Brolin as Thanos is a flawless performance."
"Fantastic Marvel film that I've rewatched more times than the others. This film absolutely stands on the shoulders of many before it it does not hold up on its own. In context however it's freakin awesome and my only complaint is I want a lot more and I want it now!"
"Nowhere near as deep or interesting as it wants to be (or heck even its comic book) Infinity War nevertheless is an entertaining Marvel film that does get you excited to see what comes next for the "real" ending."
"Entertaining enough. Maybe the superhero phase has been too played out for me. Infinity War is a solid entry into the Marvel universe. They did a great job at including all of the characters and getting them on the screen. One of the key aspects that I liked about this movie was that they explained who Thanos is and what his motivations are."
"the movie was damn near perfect with the right amount of different marvel characters without making the movie feel like it just tried cramping all the characters in it. can't wait to watch part 2 next year."
"Disappointing commercial hype fest. Characters where way to soppy and the "no lives for lives" philosophy is fucking stupid. Thanks was great ending felt genuine and harsh music wasn't bad and it spawned a lot of good memes. Overall not worth watching in my opinion."
"best movie ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"The fight scenes were amazing. The film does the unexpected a lot so plan on anything happening. The movie is over 2 and a half hours but it didn't feel like it with the fast pace. The film does a great job of wrapping up 10 years but leaves a HUGE cliffhanger"
"For a movie that has to accommodate an estimated 76 characters it was pretty good. As a consequence of having so many characters there really weren't any character arcs and there wasn't much development for anyone but Thanos. It felt like a mashup of action sequences some that didn't fit together smoothly but I think that the directors did the best they could with this huge project. They also paired up characters who would have good chemistry with one another or who would create amusing conflict which I thought was clever. As usual the action sequences were excellent and well choreographed. There were some romances which were previously undeveloped and felt very last-minute. If you're a Bruce Banner fan you'll be happy with the generous screen time he's given here; same for Scarlet Witch fans. I think that the villain was also a success; Thanos seemed more reasonable than most antagonists and was very well set up. I was very happy with that end credits sequence and I wish I could spoil it for you but that's not what I do. If you're a Marvel fan I'd definitely recommend Infinity War. Just know that lots of people "die" in this movie so don't say I didn't warn you (I'm sure they'll be back it is a comic book movie)."
"Best movie I have ever seen after the dark Knight..."
"Absolutely fantastic! The visuals and the CGI in this movie are stunning and beautiful. There are many heart-warming and devastating scenes. This movie will go down in history."
"A movie designed for marvel fans; with every beloved character villain backstory and location in the MCU. Everything alltied up together in a bow is almost rushed and most definitely confusing for non-marvel fanatics. Leaves you thirsting for part two."
"Avengers: Infinity War is massively entertaining and spectacular. What an experience! Enough said."
"I'm impressed with how well they pulled off the new back story for Thanos. I still like the whole in love with Death thing better and it's a bit confusing that Thanos goes from caring about a little girl fighting for her life to sending her to fight to the death at some point later on. Knowing the release schedule of future films really undercuts the weight of the ending too; it's already clear who's going to be back by the end of Avengers 4. But this is the first movie ever to completely capture the feel of an event comic. The Guardians running into Thor Wong meeting Stark Spidey on a spaceship these are the kinds of things that you can usually only see in comics. What an amazing universe Marvel has created despite all the superhero fatigue it never ceases to amaze me. I just want to go back in time to 2006 to show little Adam writing a biography about Stan Lee everything that these movies would be able to pull off."
"Definitely well worth the wait. The only issues I have are with hulk/bruce banner and some comedy where it didn't fit in tonally."
"In a word "epic". I was not one minute bored or it felt too long or anything. Just great. And I actually wonder how the critics ( yes only 16% ) managed to "meh" this movie when they lifted "The last Johnson" to high heaven.....especially at RT."
"A great arc slowly build over the years. Fantastic plot great action amazing villan with a realy compelling back story (finaly matched just by Black Panters villan!). One of my favorite movie ever!"
"I just want to introduce to all my readers to my criticle of the movie Avengers Infinity War the directors was the brothers Russo Anthony and Joseph V. This movie have the genres of action and Syfy. The movie was setting in a lot of places like: Central ParkGeorgia  Atlanta United Kingdom Scotland Edinburgh New York Berwickshire and Train station Warenley.Avenger 3: Infinity War have 76 principals characters in them: The guardians of the Galaxy Avengers the olds and the news Black Panther etc. But the people were more fixed in Ironman Captain America Bruce Banner Thor Thanos Vision Black Widow.The movie is about the Guardians of the Galaxy Black Panther Avengers the new and the olds Wakanda saving the Universe of Thanos that want to destroy the half of the population in the Universe so our heroes are going to sarificated all to prevent that. I think that the movie is good because mark like a time in the line time of Marvel.It have a good cinematography i think that they made a god mix of colors in the suits and in the background of the movie and the cameras was good and I like the form they record they do it in good angle. Itdont have to much songs but in the enter of Ironman and Thor i like that songs. Special effects was amazing I they do it very good. Special effects that the movie transfer was saddest because of the deaths of a lot of characters.I give to the movie an 10 because it was all what I expected of Marvel because this movie it has been doing since 2016. I think that they would be happy because of the time that the Marvel Company takes to do this movie exactly how people want it. This movie teach that you never valorate something until you lost it.I just want to introduce to all my readers to my criticle of the movie Avengers Infinity War the directors was the brothers Russo Anthony and Joseph V.

"This movie was great and I loved it but there parts where it just took a while but then they just rushed the ending. After Black Panther I thought this movie was going to be disappointing but it wasn't Each character has an arc and my favourite character arc was Thanoses and well Thor's arc in this film was amazing but i would have to say that Thanos was a better and more drawn out character and I think Black Panther needed more of this"
"just passing in my opinion there was just too much they tried shoving into one movie for what seemed the sake of lining up with other marvel releases."
"The film was of a high quality all the scenes were fantastically animated they stunts were performed very well and I feel that the cast all gripped there roles very well .The film was intense at parts but still had humours jokes within.The cast of stars in the film all played there roles to the highest of there abilities.All of the action scenes with explosions and fighting all looked very realistic and was of a very high standard.The ending of the film was also very intriguing which will mean the audience will wanna see part 2."
"Apart from its daring ending Infinity War feels mostly like an average film in the series albeit a pretty bloated one. It'll be interesting to see where they go from here but as it stands a lot of it borders on headache-inducing saved by the charisma of its cast."
"It's an adrenaline pumping film with your heart dropping every second this film was the first in the marvel cinematic universe to have the villain win and the ending is just heart wrenching as you get gripped so your ready for the next avengers instalment"
"Waaaaay waaaay too long. It was just more explosions and redundant. Not sure how anyone who likes these films could like it."
"Absolutely phenomenal movie. Perfected everything and did a fantastic job of bringing 2 different sides of the universe together and also juggling a very big script."
"This movie was amazing (in my opinion)!!!!"
"this film is fantastic has an amazing villain and so many great characters and even tho it feels pretty exhausting at the end the payoff is pretty worth it and surely the pinnacle of this franchise."
"The directors do an amazing job of tying up over 10 years of movies in this cinematic universe to conclude into this giant climax.Defiantly one of the best MCU films to date. Even though we had so many 'main' characters on screen each one was noticeable and whether short or long had their moment.The action scenes looked good and even though the film had a depressing tone (which i admired) compared to other MCU films there was still some very feel good moments. shout out to the actors who bounced banter and dialogue of one and another to keep this film flowing. A nice twist at the end and i look forward to seeing what Endgame brings."
"Culmination of a decade of wonderful films!"
"Although not a superhero fan I greatly enjoyed this. The film is made by the efficient pitch-perfect character interactions; something I was expecting to be impossible with so many. That genuinely subversive unexpected ending with implied hints that it is not... If only The Last Jedi or Justice League could have learnt these lessons."
"Very nice. A bit sluggish some parts but brilliant on others. Still think Thor: Ragnarok is the favourite of the ones I've seen."
"Very good lots of action and suspense"
"This movie's so lit. That was awesome. #1 movie around the country. :)"
"An extremely dramatic and intense movie but only if you watched all of the MCU movies. And actually the first movie in the MCU in which the villain has a reasonable motivation for his action I can comprehend."
"Barring some of the rather rash decisions made by the characters this is arguably one of the best movies in the Marvel Universe currently. Lots of plot development cool action sequences and the culmination of nearly a decade of movies comes together to form this blockbuster masterpiece."
"Could have used a few fewer characters... won't name names but you know who"
""Infinity War" was a good Marvel film that raises the stakes! Can't wait for "Endgame"!"
"This movie is very touching.Maybe Marvel's movies are better than DC's because they can all string up. l like it."
"Earlier in the MCU the stable characters were treated with more respect. Unfortunately the Cultural Marxist turn has been more and more noticeable in Marvelï¿½(TM)s movies. And based on what they have said they intend to take the next phase of the movies even further that direction. So far as Infinity War is concerned it was a mixed bag. Where Cultural Marxism was absent the movie was great. But where character story and dialogue decisions were made with an ideological bent the movie suffered. Iï¿½(TM)ll enjoy the good in it disregard the bad and plan on saving a lot of money over the next few years money that Marvel would have found in its pocket had it not decided to spit on the decades of fans that have kept it afloat all these years."
"Avengers: Infinity War inevitably has some tonal and pacing inconsistencies but its issues are quickly swept aside for charming character moments incredible comic book action and a villain for the ages making it the truly epic conclusion to the MCU's ten-year journey."
"Avengers Infinity war is a movie has stunning visuals and interesting story arks."
"it was a total chaos. You will suffer from difficulty of breathing and early stage of anxiety. The film is an epic. It will go down as a CLASSIC!"
"Great effing job. Justified why the MCU are exists. Hard to top this."
"Good for a background movie. Not very high stakes in a fakey fake universe where people don't actually die or if they do we don't care. Also the visuals were not impressive (wow look at what a computer can do. Who cares.). Lot of cutting to different storylines. Included strange character motivation a lot of scene stretching nonsense simplicity and I'm glad the villain wins even though I don't give a crap about Bruce Willis' silly purple character. Couple funny moments a good performance or two."
"Eu amei o filmepois ele finalmente une quase todos os personagens importantes da Marvel e ainda mostrou uma grande batalha no Universo Cinematogrï¿½fico da Marvel"
"Best movie in the MCU. Exhilerating funny action packed and leaves plenty more in the next array of films to come."
"One of the best superhero films I have ever seen"
""YOU SHOULD HAVE GONE FOR THE HEAD""
"The beginning of the end an imperfect but certainly gratifying start for that final push. An unprecedented cinematic journey ten years in the making and spanning the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe Marvel Studios' "Avengers: Infinity War" brings to the screen the ultimate deadliest showdown of all time. The Avengers and their Super Hero allies must be willing to sacrifice all in an attempt to defeat the powerful Thanos before his blitz of devastation and ruin puts an end to the universe.One thing that I want to commend this film for is the writing and the insane expectedly massive crew behind this film. With the list of credits alone I would love to recognize everyone who put work into this film but there's just too many. For now I want to give credit to the writers along with the Russo brothers. It's a challenging task to write a story featuring one big name but to feature a script with 70+ characters is absolutely insane. These are all the superheroes we've come to know and love with 10 years worth of story given to them. Here we get to see them all collectively come together in one place and I can't even imagine how difficult it was to write something like this. It was amazing and they took on an ever so challenging task and I applaud them. Most people can recognize it but most won't truly appreciate how difficult it is to write an ensemble of characters especially one this big with a bunch of people we love and adore. Thanos thankfully is the best Marvel villain we've ever had on screen. When I say that I mean the best. Not once in Marvel history have we had a villain this powerful and scary that could truly challenge our heroes. I mean come on Thor is a god. Captain America and Bucky are essential super soldiers. Iron Man Doctor Strange and the Hulk are some of the smartest and strongest people alive. The team has assassins in Black Widow Gamora and Nebula. They have the support of so many more powers and even the support of a "rabbit" and a tree. The fact that it literally felt like Thanos was physically unstoppable went such a long way. He even had a deep emotional side to him. I felt like I really was able to jump on board with his intentions and he was a great antagonist both physically and mentally. He's the scariest villain we've had so far and Marvel's notoriously weak villains will definitely be forgotten when it comes to naming the best one yet Thanos. One thing I really loved about this film was just the emotional scale that it achieved. This is 10 years worth of story and life coming together here and even though I'm not the biggest Marvel fan I'm amazed at all they've been able to do. This franchise started in a cave with Tony Stark creating a dingy ghetto suit. It's now turned into all of this and it was such a privilege to be able to watch this film. Seeing everything and everybody come together for one collective thing was so awe-inspiring in my eyes. For the ending it may not be the most cemented outcome but one thing's for certain it was emotional. Seeing Thanos snap his fingers and half of the world dissipating away was one of the most powerfully charged moments in Marvel history for me. Seeing our beloved characters whither away hit so many heart strings for me and while I have a theory of what happened I don't want to get into that. I just want to talk about how effective it was to see our heroes literally transform into dust and the world being left in chaos. This is the "Star Wars: Empire Strikes Back" that the Russo's have wanted to make. The world is in distraught and literally more than half our heroes are gone. This film was also visually stunning. I didn't love all of the camera work and the styles that the Russo's went with but it was visually impressive. The CGI was top notch the heroes all looked fantastic Thanos was extremely detailed and the landscapes were beautiful. This movie looked gorgeous and I definitely think it's one of the better looking Marvel films. There were some shots and moments that are still linger in my mind and it's certainly a good reason to watch this film alone. In the end I really can't wait to see where Marvel takes this next. I want to keep guessing and assuming but I trust the the Russo brothers have a plan and that they'll take the necessary risks and choices that this franchise needs to do. I loved my experience here and it certainly lived up to everything I wanted it to be. It's nowhere near perfect and it's got its issues which is why I can't rate it perfectly but it was an amazing experience that I'm grateful to have had and I think they did an amazing job with this."
"Very good movie that goes into the story line deeply definitely a must see."
"Ten years waiting for 2 hours well spent"
"good comedy and great action but i think that the jokes should've been more diverse instead of just name jokes"
"A good start for the final."
"With great special effects good acting great jokes and working really hard to fill plot holes this is arguably the best movie Marvel has offered us EVER!"
"Everything seems to be in a rush watching the film should have lasted longer to have a better pace."
"Better than the average superhero movie of today although still a little overrated. Combining all these characters into one film was interesting and worked out better than I thought it would. Thanos turns out to be a powerful cinematic villain that makes this fight especially challenging. (First and only viewing - 12/31/2018)"
"The ultimate comic book movie to leave you in shock. Every character gets good screen time and Thanos is the best Marvel villain yet. You will be shook."
"An aamazing and thrilling entailstrongly advised to both the avid marvel universe fan 65 year old with no knowledge of the marvels at all and everything inbetween. the story is perfectly climaxed and incredbly detailed. the cast is one of the most amazing line ups of blockbuster actors ever in the history of the entertainment industry and if that isn't the only provocation you need to convince you that this is a must see then i don't know what will"
"Big scale Unpredictable story and attarctive villans.(especially thanos) Actually i'm not a big fan of mcu but definetely this is one of my favorite."
"Surpassed expectations. It was so perfect I could cry."
"Such an enjoyable watch. Impressively juggles the stories of so many characters. Brilliantly written villain and amazing visuals."
"The only mistake of the movie is that all the Wakanda was risked just to save a PC!!!"
"It was a extremely great movie and for anyone reading this I'd recommend reading the book then watching this. Saw more than one time using free app Boxxy software with german subtitles."
"The best movie i've ever seen"
"omfg this movie was so awesome it actually hurts"
"Great movie with a lot of action and laughs"
"It mostly works outside of the usual issues when having 20 main characters in a 150-minute movie."
"The best team up movie ever with gripping scenes"
"Storyline is gud but the most disappoint thing is about fighting choreography power scale between superheroes and villain example how did vision end up so fast but according to comic he's the most powerful character in avengers between thor since he had nearly cosmic power with stone on his forehead but aaahh u know marvel now owned by disney which is kinda ruined it"
"Amazing Movie. The Russo brothers have done it again as for the second time in the MCU they manage to juggle so many characters and side plots yet make the plot of the movie understandable and fun for everyone. The only disappointment is the fact that this movie meets my expectations but did not exceed them as I hoped it would."
"Wow just wow...Thats all i have."
"Avengers infinity war shows that marvel is more than capable of creating an universe of superheroes."
"The Russo brothers have somehow managed to impress time and again with their films but this movie is on an even higher level of MCU entertainment. Marvel have spent ten years building this exciting connected universe where our favorite heroes from the comics can come together and interact and this movie is the peak of all that work. Every single scene in the movie draws you in and makes you want to watch more. On top of that being able to see all of the heroes that we have grown to know and love adds an unbelievable level of excitement. In addition the villain is incredibly dynamic and the most unique that the MCU has shown us so far. Moreover there is still plenty of time left for Marvel to give the audience some comedic moments that allow some reprieve from the film's unanticipated and painful ending. Audiences could only sit in anguish as some of their favorite characters were instantly taken away to somewhere unknown. The two biggest questions left to ask after watching the film are: What will happen next? and How in the world can the Russo's improve this masterpiece of storytelling and blockbuster superhero action?"
"I was honestly disappointed by Avengers: Infinity War. Overstuffed overhyped and overrated movie. I fell asleep during this movie. It was surprisingly very boring. Conversation scenes dragged on for far too long and the pacing was super horribly slow. The movie's tone lacked consistency. The movie couldn't decide whether it wanted to be a serious movie or a childish comedy. The jokes were stupid and annoying and derailed so many moments. Star-Lord was extremely annoying and childish. His dialogue was stupid this movie made me hate him. I honestly wanted Star-Lord to die. The scenes with Thor and the Guardians of the Galaxy were the worst and incredibly overlong and so boring that they put me to sleep. Peter Dinklage's performance was terrible and he was terribly miscast. Mark Ruffalo's acting was horrible. I always hated Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk and Bruce Banner. He never fit the role at all. Speaking of the Hulk he was barely in this movie. The Hulk was only in one scene in the opening when he fought Thanos but lost. I literally sympathized with and rooted for Thanos to win than any of the Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy."
"i prefer comic book films when its just 1 or 2 of them (unless its X-Men) but this was good maybe even very good we all know what part 2 will do but its all about who we see again at times it went on a bit but still a great watch"
"Avengers: Infinity War able to keep all of it's all-star cast being in the same spotlight without sacrificing another and tell a tense and thrilling story."
"One of the greatest movies I've ever seen"
"Does an amazingly great job at balancing each and every character. It also brings together a ton of stories throughout the MCU.The beginning of the movie is an extension to the end of Ragnarok. The movie officially brings Doctor Strange into the bigger conflict. The movie embraces Iron Man's overpoweredness (rather than playing it off as a fluke from Age of Ultron) and makes it Tony's downfall. It provides a great character arc for Bruce and Steve. It gives a purpose for this new broken Thor. It provides a great reason for the Guardians of the Galaxy to be involved in this at all especially with Gamora and Nebula. It establishes a relationship between Vision and Wanda. It expands our knowledge of Wakanda and just how smart the people there are. And finally this movie does all this plus a subversive ending....and none of it feels forced. It all feels perfectly natural to the overall story being told here. Can't wait for Avengers 4."
"kind of lacklustre. some characters are getting way little screen time but overall i think it's great and loved the ending."
"Look i'm not a huge fan of these comic book type super hero movies but this one was enjoyable to watch although maybe a little long but with all of the parallel hole filled plot lines you can see why they needed so much time. Josh Brolin is the star in this even though he is a CGI based character his acting shines through brighter than the rest by a long way. The ending is mind boggling killing off so many core Avenger characters but I am sure I know exactly what will happen in the sequel 'Avengers-End Game' that is out this year (2019) as there are plenty of clues during the movie (hint 'Time Stone') as this money making juggernaut (2 Billion in theaters) needs all of these characters to go on making more and more money as they inevitably will."
"I don't know how they managed to put all its characters from different franchises and make it good. I enjoyed the film a lot."
"Time reversal is a lazy plot device. It enables protagonist and antagonist alike to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. As will we no doubt see in Avengers: Endgame Marvel super heroes will be brought back from the dead (or wherever they disintegrated to) at least the billion dollar franchise ones viz. Spider-Man Black Panther."
"How does anyone like this lol"
"I mean they tried their best but that's what happens sometimes ... ."
"What an outstanding marvel movie with so many great characters that are surprisingly given a lot of development.With fantastic action and special effects and an incredible emotional ending infinity war is probably the best film in the MCU yet."
"Amazingly balanced even with a big cgi monster as the villain and they fixed their villain problem you actually feel something for thanos.Some critics complain that you have to watch everything else in the franchise to sympathize with the characters but this is NOT a stand alone movie its the conclusion to a decade of work from the marvel team.I am extremely impressed by everything in this movie and i would probably put it in my favorites of all time."
"Questo non ï¿½ cinema ma una serie di scene slegate tra di loro."
"Truly the worst movie I have seen in my entire life. Never giving another minute of my time to the hoax that is Marvel."
"One of the most ambitious franchises and films of all time following its higher stake predecessors Infinity War is a roller coaster of amazing visuals action and emotion. Marvel wants you to see this on the biggest screen possible and it's worth doing so as the massive set pieces fill the screen with great scope and inventive thrills that build on what has been built from its previous movies. The collaboration behind these movies are one of the films strongest aspects as the filmmakers play with the established traits and worlds of other movies making previous films even more essential viewing so there will be those feeling left out as this is a big love letter to the fans. Massive set pieces use the powers and abilities of our heroes so creatively they very much deserve the cheers and smiles they are sure to trigger. The Russo Brothers do a good job of giving us insight and plenty of screen time with the menacing villain who genuinely garners fear in the scenes he faces our heroes in. The massive cast all get their moments with even the new villainous henchman getting valid inclusions which are a lot of fun. The massive set of heroes inevitably means some will have lesser parts than others (some more surprising than others) which also means while they do all get some emotional payoffs we don't get the full character arcs previous films did greats jobs at building. The story is light but like a big TV show finale Infinity War ticks its plot points off one by one as it pulls out all the stops with gasps and big story turns that are sure to keep fans coming for at least its next big three projects."
"Awesome!!! It's my favorite Marvel movie not just that it's my favorite superhero movie and not just that it's my favorite movie!!"
"Favorite movie ever! Funny. Thanos is a powerful complicated villain-100%"
"With its amazing CGI and dark ending it is easily the strongest Avengers film to date."
"I'm not much into your typical superhero film but this movie definitely entertained me. Although I'm still kind of glad I didn't spend money on it."
"I really loved this movie however swearing does not make a movie any better in fact I personally think it makes it worse. I just wish producers would realize this."
"Dreadful movie. Really stupid stuff happens all the time."
"It left me speechless tearing up and on the edge of my seat even when i thought i was already at the very edge. If there was a way to put 6 stars i would most definitely do so. The Stan Lee cameo was amazing as well R.I.P."
"- Wow! What a movie! Great performances by everyone.Fantastic directing and impressivesuspense filled action.Josh Brolin rules as Thanos. Ending left me in shock"
"Depressedbrokenastoundedgiggled and dumbfucked.All of this in a single movie. Easily a milestone for comic book movies to be judged for decades. Or atleast till part 2 comes out"
"Perfect Marvel for those with no interest in a sincere plot and unable to remember what powers our heroes have. Need an example; watch Doctor Strange 2016 and Avengers Infinity War together."
"An enjoyable ride although with so many characters involved the film has no room to breathe making it cluttered."
"Una obra de arte sin duda"
"One of the best movie in my list."
"I found his a boring movie and was disappointed by the movie itself"
"This movie is what the entire MCU has been building up to and it does not disappoint. The story balances it's huge cast extremely well. While every hero gets screen time (rip Hawkeye) the focus is only on a few groups. Namely the Guardians and Thor The New York trio (Iron Man Spidey and Dr. Strange) and Vision and Scarlet Witch. But the main focus of the Movie is on the big guy himself Thanos (also Gamora) which is exactly where it should be in a movie like this."
"Most over-hyped nothing burger since Force Awakens. Spoilers follow:Huge purple guy with no powers somehow takes all the infinity stones without one single stone being used against him and kills all life in the universe but because Tony Stark kicks his ass a little he decides to spare half the population of earth. The writers of this rubbish should hand in their keyboards. I could go on and on. This movie fails on so many levels it's scary and it makes me sick that both critics and the general audience didn't see it. Yes the special effects were cool. But the dialogue was like listening to a failed comedian talk to himself. All the characters tried to be funnier than the last speaker--over and over.This movie was awful. Good riddance Avengers. It's an attempt to justify killing half the population of earth because some big purple asshole thinks there are too many people for the resources--which is a lie."
"One of the best if not the best marvel movie. The plot is interesting the caracters are awesome and all around the best movie of 2018!! Cant wait for Endgame!!"
"The biggest crossover in film history lives up to the hype and delivers on all notes with its 2 hour 40 minutes run time."
"Honestly one of the best movies I have seen in a really really long time very well done. Even if it did rip my heart apart."
"More cookie-cutter crap from Marvel. Just more of the same old same old good guys fighting bad guys that has been done before in scores of other movies. Dumb people love this stuff because they've seen it all before so they don't have to think too hard or be challenged in any way.The filmmakers try to inject some more emotional moments into this crap but they fail miserably. There's a scene where Scarlet Witch has to kill her lover Vision to prevent Thanos from getting the Mind Stone. This is supposed to be an emotional heart-rending scene but who the hell ever cared about the romance between Scarlet Witch and Vision? No one. Even the Russos barely gave their relationship any screen time.Similarly Thanos is supposed to love Gamora and when he kills her to get the Soul Stone it's supposed to be a poignant moment in the film but again I didn't feel that at all. It just reeked of a shallow attempt to inject some sort of emotion into this otherwise soulless movie.All the fight scenes sucked. Just more of the same tame PG-13 violence we've seen already in other comic book movies.The only decent parts were when the heroes die at the end. Ha ha. I laughed when Spider-Man and Bucky died. Screw them. I laughed when Black Panther died -- his solo movie sucked by the way. Oh my God that is so racist (never mind the fact that I also laughed at Spider-Man's and Bucky's deaths). I hate these Marvel movies so much I just want them all to die."
"Couldn't follow the story that well also I cried like 3 times so -1 star. The effects were really great tho!"
"If each superhero in the MCU was an infinity gem then the original Avengers was kinda like Kevin Feige's gauntlet."
"I don't like giving 5 STARS but damn... Just damn."
"Thank u Rusosï¿½ 1/2(TM)ï¿½ 1/2ï¿½? 3/4ï¿½ 1/2(TM)ï¿½ 1/2ï¿½? 3/4ï¿½ 1/2(TM)ï¿½ 1/2ï¿½? 3/4"
"Best MCU movie in my opinion."
"This is an enjoyable movie. The position of the villain is a little interesting. Going in I thought they wouldn't be able to handle all of the characters in one movie but they did. I liked the opening scene too; very dramatic - I don't want to say shakespearian because I don't know much Shakespeare but theatrical and dramatic in a non-clichï¿½ way. I think most super hero movies are kind of dumb or most make me cringe but this one did not."
"Loved every moment of it."
"Avengers: Infinity War ably juggles a dizzying array of MCU heroes in the fight against their gravest threat yet and the result is a thrilling emotionally resonant blockbuster that (mostly) realizes its gargantuan ambitions."
"I REALLY LIKED IT WAITING FOR PART 2"
"Cant wait for sequal"
"Amazing movie. The best part is the ending. I feel it is apropiret to let the team that won win."
"Bland and hollow I still cannot understand how marvel movies get reviewed so positively. another painful watch-through."
"A good marvel film which was action packed as usual. Highley reccomend. However I need a sequal reall bad. What happens now???? And I noticed the end of antman linked up with infinity war sooooooo a good explanation better be put in the next film."
"now if only we could gentle half of us fleas killing our planet..."
"I think what makes this film work for me is that Thanos comes out as a man I can admire. Even though he embodies the sort of "ends justify the means" mentality I find personally abhorrent in the politics of today he comes across as a man who understands the horror of what he is doing and sees himself as the only one capable of saving the universe from itself. He is to me the protagonist of this film and its beating heart each step he takes towards victory seems somehow just and earned and when the big final act comes he proves himself to be exactly who he claimed he was"
"very good enjoyable nice cgi i love thanos (i wanted everyone to die)great for moie gooersi was sad that spiderman died thoo"
"Periodically I'd go--OH NO--is this particular tedious stupid subplot about someone I don't care about still dragging on? As with Black Panther I am SO OVER these tedious comic book adaptations that were actually better done in--and more suited for-- the comics."
"The best Avengers movie yet. It finally feels like this story is going somewhere with some risky story telling. There are still some cringey jokes and sequences but for the most part this is an excellent movie if you have 2h 30 to spare!"
"5 stars do i need to explain.."
"A terrible part of a great series of movies. Horrible writing great acting for the most part."
"We knew the end was coming for half the universe in the the highly anticipated blockbuster but neither the 2nd or 3rd really held up the greatness the series once was 78%"
"The best superhero movie of the year Avengers: Infinity War completely surpassed my expectations. Infinity War perfectly brings together everything that has took place in the MCU into a thrilling climax. But even without the action and stunning visual effects this film is still funny dramatic and fantastically acted by everyone involved."
"this is absolutly my favorite marvel movie"
"I watch this on the second day it was in theaters I left feeling so empty just rewatched it since Netflix has it now and now I feel empty it's a great movie but it will hit you hard."
"By far the best MCU movie made by Disney i loved what the Russo brothers did with the Captain America movies and they really surpassed themselves with Infinity war. I wish they had also been in charge of new Star wars trilogy xD"
"Avengers: Infinity War ï¿½" Was a lot fun for me. While I donï¿½(TM)t go running anymore (bad knees) I would compare the film. To putting on a favorite pair of sneakers/trainers and going for a really nice long run. Enjoying the experience in many ways. The action in the film is basically none stop and well done. The acting is as good as it has to be though no one character is dwelled on for too long. I laughed at some of the snappy and well executed dialog. While I am a fan of the film series and Marvel. I did have some trouble trying to remember or understand who some of the Avengers were. Itï¿½(TM)s easy to remember the Avengers who have had their own movies like Iron Man but Black Widowï¿½ Umm? It goes without saying that CGI is first rate. Lastly itï¿½(TM)s one of the few Superhero movies that I didnï¿½(TM)t feel like I was being treated like a kid and want something more ï¿½Rï¿½? rated."
"It is a depressing movie. Extremely gory. If your children like spiderman hulk vision gamora peter quill or groot this is really not a good movie for them. I would personally rate it R"
"Good enough I guess. Bad guy comes to town and kills everyone and there isn't anything anyone can do about it. The End. I will say fantastic effort getting all those characters in in the most organic way possible. Good effort on that end. But IDK these Marvel movies are starting to feel hollow to me. ok concept ok execution. I probably will never rewatch by my own will."
"I like Avengers: Infinity War. It is one of the world's greatest movies of all time."
"Though it may not qualify as a movie in the strictest sense Infinity War ably manages a sprawling cast while delivering dazzling action sequences and successfully subverting expectations."
"This part is the best. I will to wait the next part."
"3.5*-too too long-unreal cgi/action sequences/direction-most performances great (not DS)-thanos a great "new" villain"
"How is it possible to have so many strong characters in the same film at the same time and it not be a mess? I don't know but they have done it! The best superhero film ever made! Absolutely loved it!"
"one of my favorite movies"
"Set up to fail under its unprecedented weight Infinity War emerged a total cinematic triumph. This incredible achievement cannot be praised highly enough."
"An excellent movie the MCU has been building up years for. By no means should this movie work with all the characters jammed in but it does. Once in a lifetime experience for me following this franchise for a huge part of my life."
"Still the best movie of 2018."
"Just awesome! Take my money!"
"I am a marvel fan however I have to admit that this is not a movie this is one large action sequence. There is no character development whatsoever meaning that newcomers will not care about anyone. Dialogue is poor and honestly it was exciting it was better than justice league but we have been spoon fed the plot for a decade and the movie is very predictable M night Shyamalan needs to twist this movie up a bit its so straight forward and bland"
"Sometimes it's not the ending but the journey. The problem with this movie is that apart from a few laughs the journey was pointless."
"Great movie full of action great story awesome cast."
"Finally all the Avengers meet again. You know if they donï¿½t make it out alive in Avengers: ENDGAME... Iï¿½m going to sue them for making a villain win."
"The movie was perfect the effects and the actuation are great."
"A solid addition to the MCU. Pretty epic in too many ways. First of a two-part movie series it left me hanging at the end. I don't like that...hence the 4 stars."
"I enjoyed seeing all my heros come together and it was full of non stop action"
"Overall Great but you won't know some of the characters if you are not a MCU geek. This one may make you want to be a MCU Geek!"
"Inconsistent ridiculous childish"
"Good film but rubbish ending dissapointed"
"With a premise so high for the most ambitious crossover ever. It is really refreshing to see a movie that can take that premise. and make it big like marvel."
"The ending shocked me. I know I love it when I think and feel the film the next day. My heart felt such sadness my God this film really touched me in the end."
"Good Writing: 1.5 StarsGreat dialogue between the characters. Key characters make poor choices and don't utilize their abilities for the sake of drama.Great Production: 2 StarsA lot of time went into CGI. This is largely what the movie consists of and it does a good job it would be nice go see more practicals"
"By far the best movie in the MCU"
"Marvel has finally made a film where it had stakes high tension and a great villain that really takes this series to some new levels. My biggest problems with the series were all fixed in this."
"Rating: 96. The biggest blockbuster I have ever seen in my life. I loved it from the laughter and happiness too the drama and loss just make me prefer it even more than Black Panther. Avengers 3 also has one of the biggest cliffhangers since the Empire Strikes Back."
"This movie delivers all that it has been leading up to. From the sentimentalism the characters make you feel to the edge of your seat scenes you cannot look away from. This movie is enjoyable for all audiences whether you are a die hard Marvel fan or just looking for a good time. From the fits of laughter to the sniffles and tears. Infinity War serves movie goers justice.!"
"Yet another long winded over CGI piece of bad storytelling. There are parts of the MCU which are amazing standalone stories Iron Man Captain America. This is the third disappointment for me with the avengers storyline. Long winded dry boring dialogue. And ridiculously dramatic over drawn out CGI fight sequences.For all the same reasons that the Transformer movies started out great but quickly became stale and formulaic this Avengers movie has hit the stale yet again. Ultron was borderline for me. Civil War was painfully dreadful. This hit another low. Two hours of my life that ill never get back. Shame on Marvel for just creating a juggernaut series and then feeding their fans swill in attempts to sell tickets."
"Oh... My... God. There is so much I want to say but I can't!!! This review is really difficult for me for three reasons: 1) there has really never been a movie like this before 2) it's a challenge to remain objective when I am such a raging Marvel superfan and 3) it's everything I can do to prevent myself from talking about the spoilers... of which there are many and which I am dying to talk about at length and in detail. I will give the disclaimer that my rating is more of a reflection of how much I enjoyed this movie rather than the actual "quality" per se. No one will ever say this is one of the greatest movies of all time... but damned if it isn't one of the best times I have had at the movies and I am going to shamelessly gush about it. The Directors Russo did a superb job of merging at least 6 different storylines from a whopping 18 (EIGHTEEN!!!) prior films with a staggering number of characters into one cohesive film. It was an incredibly ambitious undertaking and they really pulled it off. They even brought back a few characters that were long forgotten managed to add some new ones AND found enough time to develop the villain the formidable Thanos (who would have been a bit more formidable if they had done more than just slap a huge chin on Josh Brolin - his tiny face by comparison is just laughable). That's not even considering the drastic differences in tone style and setting that have been established for each of the franchises individually. It's a remarkable feat that this film (mostly) tempers and blends all of those differences as it weaves in and out of the different storylines while creating a style/tone of its own. This is by far the darkest of all of the Marvel films - everything is not all sunshine and roses and it doesn't leave you with a warm feeling in your belly that you'd expect from a superhero film. Thanos is by far the most daunting villain we've seen so far and all our heroes combined have to run the gauntlet to present even the slightest challenge for him (I really worked hard to get that "gauntlet" pun in there). It gets shockingly grim. Paradoxically it's also a total blast... it's weird for a movie to be both exhilarating and devastating at the same time. This movie is a Marvel fan's wet dream but proceed with caution - it's for fans ONLY. The film assumes that you will know who everyone is and what makes them all tick and does not waste any time with explaining things to the uninitiated. There is just no room with all the cross-franchise introductions gags quips and fights... so many fights! This movie is wall-to-wall action and I will admit that by the end it gets a little overwhelming. It hits the ground running and doesn't stop but still makes plenty of room for humor and a surprising amount of emotion. It's a lot but not too much as I had feared it would be. And it's NOT what I expected but I loved it all the more for that. I am still reeling from the ending... and am already anxiously awaiting the next Avengers installment."
"B?R GRUP ?NSANIN ARALARINDAK? ANLA?MAZLIKLARA RA?MEN EVREN?N KADER? ?ï¿½?N NELER YAPAB?LD?KERL?N? ANLATAN Gï¿½ZEL B?R H?KAYE (HULK HAR?ï¿½) :))))))"
"I mean if I actually watched and liked Marvel movies I'd probably say this was good. I applaud the twist ending that Marvel never really has. I assume though the second part will end how we expect."
"I had to see this twice to truly think about it. Saying that a lot happens in this movie is an understatement! Aside from a few pacing issues I loved it! Marvel took a huge risk trying too cram so many characters and situations into a 2.5 hour movie! I felt like some of the characters didn't get quite enough attention compared to others but it was still really fun to watch how different heroes interacted with each other. This film was an emotional roller coaster by providing some of the funniest jokes from the MCU so far while also upping the stakes for some truly emotional heart-wrenching losses. Thanos is definitely the strongest villain from the franchise both in strength and in characterization. And the fight scenes are absolutely epic! The entire film is full of non-stop action that leaves you full and overwhelmed by the end but it also leaves you wanting more after a finale that completely changes the superhero movie formula!"
"Russo brothers did the impossible. Great movie for the fans whoï¿½(TM)ve seen every MCU film and a great movie for fans who havenï¿½(TM)t. All the characters are balanced and Josh Brokin ad Thanos is possibly the best villain the MCU has had since Loki in Avengers 1."
"Went through every single emotion watching this film! Acting as per was brilliant and the effects were awesome. Canï¿½ 1/2(TM)t wait for the next instalment"
"worst marvel movie ever written. too many plot holes to mention. Thanos died in the first 2 minutes of the movie. The rest was just a fourth-rate writers blow job dream. I am annoyed that I even have to give it 1/2 of a star"
"This is an realy amzing movie i dont kniw why rotten tomato only give 82 to it but i think it defintely deserve a 100 marks"
"Wanna cry? Heres the perfect movie. Who doesn't love a action packed movie taking 10 years in the making."
"Nothing to criticize with this one. Amazing visuals and effects humour and emotional storyline. It manages to pull so much together and teams up the characters well. Looking forward to end game."
"Great movie handled star studded cast very well"
"I have a problem with how strange and stark meet in the film. I was expecting better. But everything else is fine."
"Amazing. DC watch and learn. Bring on End Game!"
"Infinity War es increible tiene una historia muy buena un villano que es demasiado interesante los personajes ponen mucho de su parte y la hace ver increible literalmente la mejor del UCM me encanto esta pelicula eleva mucho tus sentimientos te hace llorar reir sonreir demasiado buena"
"A great movie with lots of humor and action but the movie was almost to packed making not as good as Avengers 1 or 2."
"When the MCU first started they seemed to put more emphasis on the characters of the heroes the villains and all the myriad of background characters. It was interesting and even when they failed the viewer at least had the impression that they actually cared for making something different - not in this case.Now it seems the people behind this franchise care more for big explosions and advanced computer graphics than actually weaving a story. It focuses more on throwing familiar faces on the screen than actually telling any story about those characters and even when they did start to tell some story then immediately ignored it and instead pointed the viewer to the new shiny fight scene that started without reason or merit - very much like dangling keys in front of a small child instead of interacting with that child.First the villain that no one in the writing department cared to think too much about: his character is unknown his motivations are just silly and unexplained strains of thought and most of the time he is portrayed as completely vile or a creature in eternal conflict without any balance between the two. I kept waiting for someone to tell me why? What was his thought process? How he made sense of those ideas? How does this utopia look like?Second the heroes which there are too many of and because of how many there are most of them don't speak show little to no character and have a moderate to low amount of action scenes. This becomes an issue to the point that most of them are forgettable and their inclusion becomes absolutely pointless.Lastly the story that although was interesting by starting with the conflict became way too convenient to the plot - characters placed in certain locations for the sole purpose of those characters needing to be there to further the plot character behaving in a way that serves the plot more than the character and a manufacturing of useless and pointless action scenes that go nowhere.Overall the story felt like a tedious slog through scenes and characters too much emphasis on over complicating the plot and moving characters around and little to no character development - all for making the cliffhanger as massive as possible which fails when the viewer doesn't care about the characters and situation."
"they didnt manage togive equall importance to all characters. And the story seems rushed . but thanos is good villain and manages to get the heroes riled up enough to make a wonderful movie. only disappointed in the lack of lines for the main characters."
"Personally it effected me because I feel so connected to the characters and I feel as though I know them. I've seen all the movies at least twice so I'm preeetty closeï¿½~"
"By far the best mcu movie yet!"
"Infinity War suffers since it is dealing with a boat load of characters it is hard to follow each individual plot line. I believe it was very sloppy writing since we all know every single hero who disappeared at the end of film will be back which adds little to the impact that Thanos has on mankind."
"Good super hero movie"
"The best way to bring all these heroes together. Infinity War is one of the must see's of 2018 and arguably the best film in the MCU. It's just barely not a masterpiece. I'll give it  - 95%"
"To be able to to have so many characters and have them all shine at different parts of the movie is an incredible achievement itself. Amazing movie"
"I watched it again. It's really great. There just aren't any poor scenes and the battle scenes are epic."
"awesome - thank you!"
"My 2nd favourite movie of 2018 couldn't say enough great things about this movie!!!"
"The visuals are impressive and its neat to see so many of the characters coming together but it all feels a bit overdone. We are so many films deep in the series that if you have missed one film it feels like you are jumping into the middle of a movie. The story lines are all feeling a bit repetitive and it just feels like its time to take a break from the MCU."
"The culmination of a 10-year cinematic universe doesn't disappoint as it becomes the biggest box office event since the original Star Wars trilogy. The Russo Brothers once again handle an absurd number of heroes and masterfully find enough screentime for everyone for the movie to breath but itÂ´s CGI-villain Thanos who steals the show with its ever-imposing presence."
"explosive thrilling and entertaining Avengers: Infinite War entertains the viewer with the unexpected union of all the heroes of the Marvel film universe and with magnificent action scenes and CGI's jaw-dropping although a large number of characters are no longer used. 8.5/10"
"Not the best MCU movie but must be the most emotional ones... Can't wait for End Game on April next year. I hope they do better for Iron Man CGI tho."
"I am totally shook and mindblown. I can't believe how good and bad this movie is all at the same time. I can't believe they let the movie end the way it did but there has to be another in the works. Thanos is totally and completely pure EVIL just like the EVIL lying crooked corrupt chump trump and his family and administration. This movie will make you cheer the good guys and break your heart all at the same time. There has got to be more in the works."
"Avengers: Infinity War: 9 out of 10: Well after eighteenth or so movie you know the drill. Big Universe killing bad threatens puppies and kittens and our heroes put aside their differences to defeat the big bad and someone dies because the contract negotiations were at a standstill. Yup I am sure that is what happens. Okay so the opening scene reminds me of Alien 3 but I am sure we are done with indiscriminate killing of beloved characters in brutal ways. (Two and a half hours later) Oh dear god... The Good: This is a hero's journey. The fact that the hero in question is the big bad Thanos makes this a unique Marvel film. While having a big bad on a hero's journey is hardly unknown it often isn't done this well (I am looking your way Star Wars Prequels). Thanos is a man with a plan. The Avengers are simply obstacles. And for the most part they play the role of obstacles and setbacks on Thanos' journey. Almost everyone comes to the party (sorry Hawkeye) and it is a blast. Thor meets the Guardians of the Galaxy was a particular treat. I liked the way they managed to reward viewership of the previous eighteen movies or so. Avenger's Infinity War is stuffed with Easter eggs and trivia. In fact the movie really is amazingly stuffed over a very long runtime. Forget added filler you actually get the sense they wanted to put in twice as much stuff as they did. The Bad: With truncated participation by the individual Avengers some of them tended to revert to their baseline trope even though they have had growth over the recent films. I liked Thor in this film but he seemed to be more a person who had had a psychotic break than an actual hero. (In fairness this is called out in the film by the rabbit... sorry raccoon.)Starlord as well seems to have lost two films worth of character development in many of his scenes. He also got chubby (also called out in the film by the rabbit). There is also some flotsam left over from the Civil War film that needed to handwaved better than it was. Overall though a great job bringing such a large cast together.Is it bad form to wish that the Silver Surfer was in this film. Don't get me wrong I am not a fan of the character per se. But if you have a Thanos film you need a Silver Surfer. The Ugly: Bruce Banner in the Iron Man Hulkbuster armor just never looked right. He looks like a Goomba had escaped from the set of the old Super Mario Brothers movie. In Conclusion: You know I got some flack from reviewing the original X-men movies when I pointed out that Magneto had a good point. I am not saying Thanos is right mind you but the movie does make a compelling case. If it was just humans I think I could get behind it but since it includes kittens I am morally opposed. A really good film from a series that has not lacked for great films."
"Very good movie. I had a blast and I can't wait for Endgame to see how it all resolves. Definitely will rewatch."
"Thanos is by FAR the best villain in ANY superhero flick! He was sooo good in this movie! I really hope they make him part of the Infinity Watch!!! This movie was pure FUN! Great action great laughs real loss.. Makes me want the next one NOW!!!"
"Most anticipated movie in years. Live up to anticipation."
"Infinity War has all the new characters without feeling over-bloated a surprising change of stakes and a villain for the movie history books"
"Better than expected largely due to a great villain and a well focussed story. Despite the number of main characters the plot structure succeeds in allocating enough time to each well but the tone of the movie is a little all over the place. Unquestionably the best of Avengers movies to this point."
"This latest instalment in the Avengers succeeds in bringing together a complex array of heroes to dazzle the audience with an emotional and abrupt finish."
"There must be some serious numbers of comic book nerds voting this up highly.....because this film's plot is weak the ending even weaker and generally speaking most of the movie is a repeat of one marvel character saying hi to another. Total waste of a couple of hours and not even in a good way like a no-brainer action movie."
"This is an action packed movie but it lacks character developement. I feel the movie was just one big battle. I wanted to see more suspense. The opening seen was people fighting. It lasted thr whole movie. It did not live up to my expectations"
""Andy Dwyer vs Thanos. No Leslie Knope." 4/5"
"It's kind of difficult to begin a review of a movie of such gargantuan scope and ambition such as this one. I think some movie nerds even if they admit it openly or not come to the assumption that films within the MCU or the larger Avengers movies (which brings a lot of the characters in this universe together in one film) are easy to make. I suppose they come to that assumption because the film is so obviously and openly meant for the broadest possible of audiences. They want to make sure that everyone of every age color race and gender finds something they like in these movies. And to me I find that it is the exact opposite I think these are the most difficult films to make. Not saying that other smaller movies are "easy" to make I just mean that films like the Avengers have to juggle so many balls in the air that realistically speaking it's gonna be incredibly difficult to do just for one director and writer. You not only have to serve the major arc of Thanos finally arriving (after over half a decade of constant teasing in MCU films) and attempting to complete his mission of gathering the Infinity Stones in order to obliterate half of life on earth in order for it to be 'balanced'. But at the same time you have to find a way for every major character in the MCU at least the good guys to have a role to play and for that role to make sense within the context of the story you are trying to tell. When you compare this film to the first two Avengers films or even something like Civil War (which was the movie that Age of Ultron should have been) in terms of scope and ambition this movie blows them out of the water even if I felt that Civil War as a whole was the better movie which I'll get into later. To me the problem with Age of Ultron the second Avengers movie was the fact that it was the very definition of a hot mess. It was incredibly bloated and to me felt like a total repeat of the first Avengers except instead of Loki being the main villain it was Ultron. There was nothing really all that fresh about it and it didn't blow my mind in the slightest. I also felt that the movie introduced new characters for the sake of introducing them not because it actually made sense within the context of the story. None of the new additions really stood out in any significant way. I feel that my initial worry for this movie when I knew that this was Marvel's biggest film yet encompassing probably more than twice the major characters as Age of Ultron was the fact that I didn't think there was a way to shove so many characters in there without the film feeling overstuffed or there not being enough time to properly showcase all of its characters. And you could make the argument that that was the case here as I feel that Black Panther and Wakanda while being the place for the final major showdown were criminally underused after the success of Black Panther (which may be the best MCU film yet) as a whole. Regardless with that said Anthony/Joe Russo (directors of this film) and Christopher Markus/Stephen McFeely (screenwriters) found a way to make this gargantuan undertaking work and works about as well as anyone could have possible hoped. I think that the smartest thing that they did was split everyone up. That was probably the problem with Age of Ultron everyone was together at all times and they were all fighting the same enemy following the narrative path that it felt like too much at times and you didn't get enough time to breathe and/or relax. This movie smartly splits up the cast and they each have their own stories to explore. Yes everything works towards taking the fight to Thanos and stopping him from accessing the final Infinity Stones he needs in order to obliterate planets with a snap of his fingers but you explore Vision and Wanda's relationship as an example and this helps a lot because Wanda and Vision were unessential characters in previous films. Vision has one of the Stones implanted in his head so Thanos needs him. In fact Vision's stone is the last one that Thanos collects. So Thanos needs Vision alive as the good guys attempt to find a way to destroy the Stone so Thanos can't access it. Regardless I did like Vision and Wanda more in this movie. Thor is off on his own with Rocket Raccoo and Groot in order to forge this axe that will hopefully help them defeat Thanos. Thor is also dealing with survivors' guilt as of the Asgardians he is the only one to have survived. The Guardians of the Galaxy are on Gamora's trail after Thanos takes her in order to gather the Soul Stone as she knows where it's located. Iron Man Dr. Strange and Spider-Man take the fight to Thanos' planet Titan where they hope to stop him there (Strange also possesses one of the Stones the time stone which of course lets him control time). Captain America Black Widow Falcon Banner and Winter Soldier are off in their own. They help plot the plan to remove the stone from Vision with the Wakandans' help. I don't know if I missed anybody but the point I'm trying to make is that all of the characters are spread out so scenes have a lot more time to breathe. You can jump from story to story without the movie feeling like it's becoming too much at one time. With that said however the fact that this is Marvel's biggest undertaking yet means that some major heroes are gonna die. I think they made a really smart choice in ***MAJOR SPOILERS*** killing off Loki in less than 10 minutes. That's how you know they're not fucking around. That's been the problem to me in a lot of these MCU films a lot of what happens feels inconsequential. Not that they're bad movies or anything of the sort it's just that if anyone dies it's a secondary character not essential to the plot or the villain him/herself. So for this movie to not feel like another run-of-the-mill 'villain of the week' film like most MCU entries they did have to kill off some really major character. In fact I think that by the end of the movie if my math is correct something like SEVENTEEN major characters died (and Vision actually dies twice once by Wanda's hand at Vision's behest and the other by Thanos after he rewinds time to remove Vision's Stone). I believe three others died in the second Ant-Man movie so that's 20 major characters killed off by Thanos. Thanos almost by default really is the best villain the MCU bar none. And I don't mean that because he's actually the first villain to ever you know actually win instead of the good guys but I do think that he is an incredible presence wonderfully performed by Josh Brolin. What I like about Thanos is that in his own mind he feels like he's doing the right thing. He's bringing order to the universe by wiping out half of all life on every planet he visits. Overpopulation has lead to hunger and in his own way he does this so the planet itself can prosper and not slowly drag itself into extinction. I suppose you could make the case that every villain in the MCU feels like what they're doing is the right thing but I don't think they've ever done it as skillfully as they have with Thanos. You don't agree with Thanos of course but he rationalizes his reasoning better than most villains would. And like I said he's got an intimidating presence the CG work for Thanos is tremendous (through the use of motion capture). I love Brolin in this movie because there's something that he adjusts about his voice that gives Thanos a lot of strength and power. He's not a character that needs to yell to get his point across or to be threatening. He's got a very subdued manner of speaking and I don't know but I thought that Thanos in my opinion lived up to the hype as a villain. But of course this being a Marvel movie it isn't all doom and gloom. I mean yes billions of people on earth are at risk of being killed by Thanos but I think Marvel understands that you also need to have some comedy to liven things up. I don't think this is as funny as a film like say Deadpool (1 and 2) but it's a very entertaining movie. Drax who has probably grown to be my favorite character in this entire universe has THE best line in this movie and quite possibly the entire MCU. Dave Bautista has honestly been a really fucking pleasant surprise to watch as Drax. His comedic timing and delivery is impeccable. I wish I could go over everyone in this movie but there's way too many people to go over. Just know that as always since a lot of these people have been playing these characters for more than six years everyone is great here with no real discernible weak links to me at least. In short the movie is just an absolute fucking blast to watch. It manages to fulfill every expectation I could have expected. Having said that and this is referring to a point I made earlier when I said that I said Civil War was still better than this. The reason I mention that is because this really feels like they went the route of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows they divided it up into two parts because there was too much story to tell. And I don't blame them for that why get just one multi-billion dollar movie out of it when you can get two. With that said however this still feels very much like an incomplete movie. The next movie Endgame which comes out in less than four months is gonna complete this story. That doesn't mean that this doesn't stand on its own merits and the bad guy finally wins for once and that's a big thing for this universe. It still feels very much like half of a movie that it is. It gets you pumped and excited for Endgame for sure but it's still an incomplete experience. That's why I don't feel comfortable giving this a higher rating than four stars (which is still fucking great mind you). Civil War felt like it was a complete story a story that had repercussions that were felt in THIS movie. I don't know if by the end of Endgame the repercussions of Thanos' actions will be felt given the fact that the time stone can basically prevent this from ever happening. Don't get me wrong it's still a pretty damn fucking great movie it's just not an amazing one. I really don't know what else to say about this just that the impossible was done and they managed to make a movie that correctly used every major character in the MCU without feeling like it's shoving 10 hours of content into 150 minute time-frame. You know how difficult that actually is to pull off? The movie is thrilling the action is top-notch (the climactic battle in Wakanda is fantastic) and the scripting is great That's it's half of one five-hour movie aside I had a fucking blast watching this and if you've been keeping up with this universe you'd be doing yourself a disservice to not watch this. Would easily recommended."
"One film il def be telling my grandkids about one day such a special movie russo bros can def make a comicbook film ! This film is so rich of 10 years of great story telling and with all the cgi i never stopped buying into the stakes great job! And hey RDJ is in it what more do you need??!!"
"93Neatly balancing strong characters with an empathetic villain at the center Avengers: Infinity War marks another thrilling and visually delightful achievement for Marvel Studios and for the comic book film genre."
"so it's just everyone against all the enemies with no real problems and no real solution. Half way through this movie I had the distinct thought that "This is the last superhero movie you will ever see." And a year later it's still true. Seeing this film was like the ruining effect we all suffered the first time we bought a large-capacity ipod. We were drowning in music and couldn't listen to anything. We're drowning in these silly superheroes and these silly superhero mashups and can't watch anything."
"More from the makers of the Avengers. Is there any room for films with a good and solid narrative anymore is it all just FX and explosions. An OK watch. Now we have to wait for the next one to find out what happens. Let's have these types of films but not at the exclusion of other narratives. Give me Red Dog over this any day."
"Dumb movie. It looks like they are running out of stories for these characters. The best team-up movies are the X-Men."
"Waste of my money. What a crappy ending."
"Stupid movie! What happen all hype I get and this is the action they give me? I prefer Pacific rim at least I feel war in there than this rubbish movie"
"The culmination of the world building of the events from previous films sets up this massive epic. A massive powerful villain forces a huge ensemble of superheroes to team up to fight this new threat. His power is immediately felt when we discover how he was able to so easily destroy half of a world and his justification is even more disturbing but grounded in reality. There is a very real concern Earth is overpopulated and the resources will not be enough to sustain the world's population. That is neither here or there as we have found creative solutions to expand the food supply.Thanos envisions himself as the solution to those problems. His view is he can be a hero by destroying half of the population in a world and the survivors will be able to enjoy the resources because they will not be taxed beyond their limits. He sees the suffering the people mentioning starving children and disease as part of the effects of an overpopulated world. The problem is Thanos only sees the solution to this issue as destroying a population instead of examining a realm of possibilities.However his thought process is one of the most interesting and compelling reasons for a villain to exist. Most times their purpose is unclear and they are just kind of there especially in a Marvel movie. Typically the villain is not up to task and presented as all powerful but not really believable in this manner. Thanos is given much more time to develop and we are all the better for it with the most compelling bad guy in this universe. Josh Brolin infuses the role with genuine pathos and you actually do care about this character.There is a poetic beauty about the way he speaks and he is so philosophical where his crazy ideas almost sound reasonable. Of course there is no reason for his destruction and he does not consider how the devastation affects a population. His character plays well as one you would expect a whole team of superheroes would struggle to take down. He has the perfect combination of smarts strength and knowledge combining to make him an unstoppable force. This is largely Thanos' journey to gain the Infinity stones so he can carry out his vision of a different world.We experience heartbreak and a lot less joking around typical from this company. The refreshing part is the filmmakers give weight to this story and do not rely solely on humor dispensed a mile a minute. This is one of the more serious movies in the shared universe to date deciding to allow the audience to breathe in the full repercussions of Thanos' decisions. This will fully be explored in the next film. I am interested to see how they address Thanos.Pacing is the only real problem where the movie takes a while to find its feet. The first hour is largely dedicated to showing each of the superheroes in their state of personal sacrifice embodying the hero qualities we all love. The fighting scenes they engage in are spectacular but the film gets bogged down early on reminding us the vastness of the Thanos threat. This early part of the movie could be pared down to streamline the narrative. The intelligence of the audience could be trusted a little more to see the very real threat coming to this world.Once the film gets going there is hardly a moment to catch your breath and you are waiting with anticipation to see what will unfold. There is a sense of finality with this film perhaps being one of the last films of this phase. There is a lack of joy in this picture but it allows this massive ensemble to stand out from the other cutesy films. A real villain with a complexity rarely explored makes me want to see more of Thanos. An emotional depth and appropriate screen time to each character combines to build a very satisfying picture. Emotional payoff is given in spades here and I am truly excited to see what is in store for the next film."
"The worst marvel movie of all times I had to make a rotten tomato account just to rate it and this is my first rating as you can see how disappointed I am. The movie has too many jokes and takes away the whole them but they did a great JOB ON THE VENOM ..."
"An amazing movie overall with some great shots and a lot of character development for characters like black panther and especially Thor. However some characters get lost in the shuffle like falcon and bucky and that's my big issue with avengers too many characters and even though the russos try to balance scenes and give every actor equal screen time the overall product feels quite disjointed and all over the place."
"This movie is so incredible.Marvel did it again"
"It could have been so much better..."
"It was a movie a little different of other Marvel Movies.Especially the very dark final with everybody's death. #SADEverything works perfectly it's the best movie of 2018 for sure!"
"Outstanding movie. Great masterpiece and so worth 10 years of waiting :)"
"Holy Crap! Everyone doing everything at the top of their game! Plus you gotta love Marvel playing Thanos honestly not an easyily pigeonholed bad guy."
"They should bring this kind of film only on netflix it's not cinema it's a tv series"
"No need for a long review you need just one word to describe this movie:Amazing"
"Es buena pelicula falta la resoluciï¿½n con endgame se nota el buen trabajo de los Russo tienen un gran manejo de los personajes las escenas de accion son muy buenas emocionantes una gran pelicula para disfrutar varias veces."
"Most ambitious movie of the MCU so far. Loved Thanos and how all this characters get together to fight a common threat. Amazing action sequences and a very good cliffhanger by the end of it that makes you want more."
"An amazing movie that brings all MCU characters together without being too cumbersome. The action and story is great!"
"I could go on and on about this movie but I will keep it short. A movie with so many characters and so much hype from fans I was nervous it would fail. Instead it left me speechless and hoping for more. It is absolutely giant which makes it one of the most rewatchable movies ever (I've rewatched it many times already and still love it). With a great mix of funny quips incredible action and emotional scenes it has to be up there with (Dare I say) The Dark Knight as one of the greatest superhero movies ever made."
"I wish superheroes would be superheroes not comedians. My love of superheroes is because they were superheroes not comedians"
"Avengers: Infinity War is my favorite film in the MCU. The action is on-point the quippy moments are funny and the ending got me teary-eyed. It's the kind the movie that leaves you wanting more and it makes you feel excited for what's coming up next. I loved this movie and I cannot wait until Avengers: Endgame hits theaters."
"Thanos is the MCU's best villain yet in a film that has no right to be as good as it is. It's half a story it has too many characters to focus on... and yet somehow marvel sticks the landing with a poise we've yet to see in the superhero genre. Just don't count on this one making a lick of sense if you've not put in the time to see the previous chapters."
"(95/100)''Oh my god'' were the only words that I could describe this movie with. Avengers: Infinity War is a game changing spectacle with a lot of great fun action and sad emotional moments. Thankfully you really feel for Thanos (Josh Brolin) and you kind of understand his point of view. SPOILERS AHEAD DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED. Killing this many characters on screen in this manner is truly unexpected I really hope everyone returns because of the Time Stone or something because wow I'm shocked. Spider-Man's (Tom Holland) death was truly heartbreaking and Gamora's (Zoe Saldana) also. I like that they don't beat Thanos (Josh Brolin) yet and that we need to see another Avengers movie it isn't as simple as some think. It has some great character development and a really intriguing plot. Avengers Infinity War lives up to the hype and even exceeds its hype. Best movie in the MCU so far."
"Don't know where to start. Avengers: Infinity War is one of the biggest cinematic events in our generation. A timeline and build up of that scale have never been executed better. The movie breaks boundaries with the rare "Sad Ending". It left us with a cliffhanger but after all its a two parter. The characters had balanced screen times and Thanos felt like a grounded real life character. His motives were clear and he didn't stop until he achieved his goal. Didn't think a movie of this scale can be pulled off. The Russo Brothers did not disappoint."
"que pende-jara es esa pelicul no dc se la rifa"
"Avengers: Infinity War the culmination of what 20 films have been leading up to truly is the most ambitious cinematic superhero crossover event of the year."
"I want to tell you about this movie it is called Avengers Infinity War. If I would rate this movie I rate it 5 stars here's why. The movie has a lot of action and all of the actors fit in well when I see the fighting scenes I feel like i'm there. The movie is 2 hours and 20 minutes long and every single part of that 2 hour and 20 minutes are action with a very good story line. I would suggest watching the prior sequels of the avenger movies. The sounds feel real for example the guns spaceships and when they go to the planets they look real everything looks real in the movie this is for sure the best movie of 2018 I recommend this movie to everyone go watch it right now!"
"The Marvel Universe showing that it can still surprise us with decisions that they took and making the villain the protagonist was a genius stroke. I mean even I could see the logic in Thanosï¿½(TM) plan."
"Avengers: Infinity War is a 2018 American superhero film the sequel to 2012's The Avengers and 2015's Avengers: Age of Ultron. The film is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo. This is the first of the modern superhero movies that I have actually enjoyed The humorous edge was present throughout and there were often so many quick one-liners that I missed some of them. This was also partly due to the dialogue which was too soft. Although there were some slight similarities with Star Wars end even Harry Potter what surprised me most was the depth of the narrative especially towards the end. And the unexpected ending certainly left me wondering. Now I look forward to the sequel.The highest grossing film of 2018."
"Best villain to date.Every character worked into the movie very well.Great action.86%"
"Una pelicula demasiada buena Buen guion Buenas actuaciones Y buen final"
"One of the best Marvel movie. Funny thrilling and emotional. The movie is more of a Thanos movie his goal his relationship with Gamora and his justification for wiping half of all life. The interaction between Tony and Strange is really fun to watch along with Peter. Thor and the guardians were the funniest part of the movie. The fight scene between Steve and Co. And Black order was fantastic. The Battle's on Titan and Wakanda were a treat to watch and Thor's entrance was just incredible and the Snap just leaves you speechless."
"Not good because SHAWARMA wasn't in it."
"Easily one of the best films of the past 10 years"
"The best comic book film ever. This film is a true monument of film making it has been built up for over 10 years and it pays off the chemistry between the Avengers (the heroes) really works and The time most films would use to develop their heroes is used to develop Thanos making him a villain you can understand and sympathise with. Each characters actions and motivations are easily explained by how the are developed in previous films within the MCU. This film also has some of the best action in any comic book film and has many breathtaking visuals including Thanos himself."
"Just when I think Marvel movies are starting to become too formulaic they drop this gem that brings back all the characters we know and love for an entirely different kind of story. It's no small task to live up to fans expectations when 18 films have been building to this. I think people quickly forget how wrong this could have gone. Balancing this large cast of characters/stars can be incredibly difficult but somehow they made it look easy here."
"Easily the best Marvel movie of all time with great action characters comedy and the best ending yet."
"Excellent Thriller and good acting."
"Big and bold with non-stop action and a growing sense of doom as the movie moves towards it's inevitable conclusion. The pieces are in place and I can't wait to see Endgame!"
"I hate you for making me cry"
"Has as much holes as Swiss cheese. Did not find anything entertaining about it except for Captain America's entrance. The reason Thanos is able to win is because it was written that way otherwise there were a million and one points at which he could easily have been defeated. His apparent love for his "daughter" Gamora was a joke. Nonsense. Not going to be watching the next part. Might not watch it once it's out on DVD even."
"This is the biggest film I have been waiting for and is my favourite movie in the MCU screw the DC films they do nowadays Marvel make the best films!"
"Once again Russo Brothers proof their talent of directing. Of course we can ignore the aactors as well. Well written amazing directors brillian actors. A perfect phenomenal movie"
"In light of the Endgame trailer I've decided to come ahead and post a review for Infinity war! Buckle in. I never ever check my phone in the theater but this movie was so awful and just plain boring I physically could not stop myself from checking the time about an hour in. Onto the review! The characters were just doing things because the plot (if we can call that a plot) demanded it with no sense or reason. Iron Man and the Guardians got the full spotlight despite this being an Avengers movie and not an Iron Man and the Guardians movie. Thanos's plan made no sense and the focus on Thanos himself pretty much ruined the movie for me. I'm here to watch an AVENGERS movie not a THANOS movie. I don't care about this big ugly blue alien. I don't care that he feels so bad about killing people. Boohoo. Cry me a river. Anyway all of the action happens (or doesn't) because it's convenient for the plot.The ending was depressingly predictable. "Killing" so many characters (despite some of them starring in movies that recently brought in the big bucks) was a pathetic attempt at being a tear-jerker which had zero impact on me. Not because I don't like them because I do but first because it's instantly obvious that they're going to come back somehow and second because I was pretty much bored to death at this point of the movie and just desperately waiting for something to happen. Needless to say I was sorely disappointed. I have a lot more stuff to say about this movie but this is long enough already as it is. One last comment: this movie really brings home the fact that Iron Man Starlord and Dr Strange are pretty much just the same character with different costumes. That's bad writing guys."
"Avengers infinity war is a fun action packed emotional roller coaster ride from start to finish. Thanos is now my favorite comic book movie villain of all time. His conviction in believing what he is doing is right makes him a scary scary villain"
"I seen this movie the Thursday it came out but for some reason rotten tomatoes refused to let me voice my opinion. Infinity wars was a great movie we have waited all these years to see Thanos come and cause havoc and he did not disappoint the way he smashed Hulk at the beginning and then went on to put a beat down on the rest of the Avengers was great. You can tell that everyone from the actors to the people who made the coffee runs worked extra hard to make this movie a great movie. The film looked amazing every thing was on point.The biggest shock tp me was when Redskull made a brief cameo appearance . The action was awesome and their was just enough comedy but it didn't bog down the movie. The only beef I had with the movie was no Hawkeye or Antman they needed to atleast have a small cameo. Look this movie was about Thanos and his road to capture the Infinity stones and they did a very good job doing so. Everytime a Avengers movie comes out the bar gets raised high so part 4 has its work cut out and I can't wait to see it"
"Eï¿½ 1/2 1/2...ï¿½ 1/2 1/2ic"
"This movie was just wow. I absolutely love this movie. You get chills throughout almost the entire movie so suspenseful. In the end scene. The snap scene the silence in the cinema's audience the movie it's all surprising and makes you want to cry. The villain won the heroes lost completely unexpected (unless you read the comics). If you have not watched this movie yet I recommend you to even if you don't like superhero movies or if you're a fan of DC this one is just something else."
"maybe the best marvel movie so far despite there are too many characters"
"This movie is perfect!"
"I disliked the ending the only way to continue the series from here would be for thanos to go back in time which would void most of this moive in the process. i liked the movie but hated the conclusion"
"I'm just gonna say this is by far the best Marvel Cinematic Universe movie of all time box office records are being broken all over and critics are producing some excellent reviews because this may very well become the GREATEST movie of all time. Excellent visual effects and score. The plot was marvelous and very smart. I will expect technical nominations. They know how to play with our feelings and emotions and crush them as glass. I am absolutely shocked and I can't believe what I have just watched."
"Gigantic loud expensive and unfortunately empty on the inside."
"Marvel's most ambitious movie of all! Best experience in a theater I ever had!"
"Spider-man is dead ) :"
"The only cinematic experience I can compare to an epic championship game."
"ï¿½Avengers: Infinity Warï¿½? is one of the MCUï¿½(TM)s most action-packed films with well developed characters an amazing score talented actors and a great story. While the average movie-goer might be confused with all that takes place any superhero fan will surely enjoy this film."
"This movie is very impressive! Grand in scope and very epic. A villain that has a reason for a change. Excellent banter between characters and awesome fight scenes. Killer ending too ;)I knocked off a star due to the ps3 like henchmen of Thanos especially the female one.This is one for the collection."
"This movie is one of the greatest movies of the decade and it left us on the biggest cliffhanger a movie could give us which excited us for sequel on its way in 2019. Every character has enough screen time and action moments for them to be noticed by the audience and cheered for. With a movie like this it would be hard to pull it off with 22 live action heroes. The movie is seen from the antagonist's percpective (Thanos). This movie is just extraordinary and certainly Marvel's most greatest movie which is hard to do as every Marvel movie has a new element to the story we have never seen before. CLAP CLAP CLAP!!!!!"
"Good but predictable."
"ï¿½~?ï¿½~?ï¿½~?ï¿½~?ï¿½~?ï¿½~?ï¿½~?ï¿½~?"
"What a joke! Rather than making a sensible enthralling plot Marvel (Disney) used their considerable resources to buy every superhero to make a grand scale movie in a most heinous of ways."
"One of the worst movies I've ever seen! What kind of world is this when cardboard characters with awful dialogiues and a terrible storyline with a waste of special effects are able to gross more than 2 trillion $? So glad I only contributed 95c to this. I will never believe anything I read on Rotten Tomatoes again."
"One of the best MCU I've ever seen!"
"The best marvel movie I've seen!"
"A great film with tons of action humor and heartbreak. Highly recommend."
"Undoubtedly the best film I have ever seen. I'm certain Endgame will be even better."
"Better than Captain America: Winter Soldier. A+"
"Excelente pelÃ­cula junto los aspectos mÃ¡s importantes y aunque carecieron de tiempo algunos superhï¿½ (C)roes en escena fue satisfactorio ver algo distinto"
"This film exceeded my high expectations!"
"E um filme fraco com cgi porco e o vilÃ£o parece com um robo dafinicado sem expressÃ£o alguma PIOR FILME DE 2018"
"Amaze with the endings :)"
"Too long dull script underuse of characters."
"Infinity War is the best marvel movie and Thanos is the best villain. The performance that Josh Brolin gives through motion capture is outstanding. And the score visual effects and everything else was top notch. You did it again Marvel!!!"
"Es una pelicula digna de ver  se corrigieron a varios personajes como en el caso de Thor que del humor vuelve a ser serio  los guardianes de la galaxia vuelven a tener los mismos matices que guardianes 1 y perdieron en la 2  las secuencias de accion estuvieron fatales  me encantaron  lo unico que podria criticar es la falta de dedicacion a los cgi que por momentos se notaron que eran artificiales un filtro mas oscuro nunca viene mal para poner un toque de seriedad  los villanos como Proxima Midnight y el resto de la orden negra podrian haber dado un poco mas de batalla  lo mejor de todo fue Scarlet Witch"
"Same crappy unrealistic VFX often present in the Marvel movies and childish portrayal of plots ends with a sentimental goof. Sentiment is a chemical defect found on the losing side."
"Una de las mejores pelÃ­culas que e visto pero lo Ãºnico error que si le vi fue algunas faltas de lÃ³gica. Un ejemplo de la crueldad del deseo de Thanos como un ejemplo la gente llorando o algunos perdiendo algo importante otro fue la falta de participaciÃ³n importante de cada una y tal vez me odien o a la vez no y es el exceso de comedia integrada en la pelÃ­cula.La pelÃ­cula es hermosa y justamente ï¿½ (C)pica pero no es perfecta esperamo que la parte 2 quite algunos errores de la primera."
"Best marvel movie ever. Can't wait to see endgame."
"It really surprised me so much. The best marvel movie yet."
"Keeping up with fan expectations was a gigantic goal; and Infinity War is without doubt the cinematic event of the year balancing mostly well the biggest cast of the MCU and giving the fans a mature and emotional ending without loosing the humor that defines the franchise"
"I liked the movie a good one and that good special effects like thanos gathers the gems the appearance of the guardians of the galaxy and the return of the captain america and bucky I liked the final battle there is nothing wrong with the movie"
"This is clearly a movie just for true fans of Marvel movies and just Marvel in general"
"AVENGERS INFINITY WAR is AWESOME movue after 10 years from the Marvel cinematic Universe!!"
"great moviethe best movie for my life"
"This movie was garbage."
"The best Marvel movie of the decade! Features compelling storytelling great character interaction dazzling effects powerful musical score by Alan Silvestri amazing direction by the Russos and of course the brilliant acting (particularly Josh Brolin's Thanos who makes for the best MCU villain). Overall definitely one of the best superhero movies of all time and one of the finest comic book films ever made."
"The movie seemed to me the first time the best of all Marvel but I was disappointed when I saw it but at least it was epic. The problem is that I did not like the villains of this movie and neither his comedy."
"The best bang for your dollar for a super heroes flick. A visually impressive film with a story with depth. Strongly recommend."
"Marvel's best flick since Winter Soldier. Josh Brolin as Thanos was pure genius."
"Please introduce the netflix characters. other than that I loved this movie"
"Fantastic. Most who have rated it low have no understanding that this is actually part one."
"Best super hero movie of the year by far"
""Infinity War" brings the many faces of its multiple franchises together for their most ambitious film yet and the results are pretty amazing."
"I skipped most of the super hero movies but have been excited about seeing the Thanos movie since Guardians of the Galaxy. This move didn't disappoint. Thanos is the best villain in a long time. I think they could have cut out half the superheros and had a better movie."
"Such a great movie a perfect first of a two part film series. Every actor gives a phenomenal performance easy to keep fans hooked and leaving fans excited for the Infinity war sequel."
"Their more ways to kill Thanos don't give me that one way bullshit that just lazy writing"
"This is my favorite Marvel movie so far. I enjoyed it beginning to end. Wow what an ending too. Brilliant! I loved all the characters and the story. The action seemed non-stop. A lot of tough choices for the characters.It's hard to find any flaws. Maybe more Hulk but I will wait to see Part 2. It must have been really tough for the Filmmakers to give screen time to all the characters and have the movie flow but they achieved it I think.The CG was done to perfection. Nothing looked cheap or rushed like Justice League."
"Easily my favorite Avengers movie and overall a great addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe alongside the Captain America Civil War and Black Panther. There are a few too many subplots but thats understandable with a movie like this and it does have all the corny superhero lines and tropes you see in all superhero movies but those few nitpicks are easily made up for with easily Marvel's best villain yet Thanos!"
"The movie haves a good story character development a good cast and the emotional really hurt I was trying to sleep after I watched it and i didn't sleep for three hours!"
"For better or worse "Avengers: Infinity War" can be exhausting to watch but its message about consequences and its dark third act are hard to forget. My full opinion: 8.5/10."
"Best movie of the year for sure!!! It gathers all elements a really good movie needs."
"How this is so far down the list is baffling i understand Sci-Fi isn't everyones cup of tea but some of the films above are proper snooze fests....Herderity for example!"
"Currently my favourite movie. Anthony and Joe Russo and Christopher Markus and Stephen Mcfeely have been able to put all leading characters into one film without making a mess. This film kept me on my toes and entertained the whole time with funny jokes and a great screenplay as well as action scenes. Excited for the sequel!"
"It's rare that a movie leaves such a lasting impression taking over my head for a solid few days as I replay the movie in my head over and over. A finely crafted picture which expertly presents a vast array of big egos and is the best Marvel movie to date."
"The best superhero movie to date"
"This was it! The most epic and fantastic movie ever! Everyone including me felt sad and angry at the end but the rest of the movie was spot-on. From good acting good jokes good references along with Thor's badass entrance. Eat your hearts now DC! No one likes Superman anymore than they like Teen Titans GO! anyway."
"This Movie Delivers Nearly 3 Hours Of A Multiple Emotion Roller Coaster 100% Worth It"
"the perfect superhero film of the modern age!"
"it is the best marvel movie to date"
"While not the best film of 2018 it's amazing how the Russo Brothers somehow managed to blend so many characters together so well."
"Great movie and it included just enough from the source material to make it digestible for the die hard comic fans. The original comic came out in 1991 so using that as a blueprint was difficult given the change in technologymorality and maturity of the movie going public. Full of comedy and drama this movie is a must see for any sci-fi or fantasy fan."
"really good recomend it"
"This was one of the best movies I have ever seen. I have watch every other marvel movie before hand and I have to say this movie did not disappoint. I loved how there was always some sort of action going on the movie never "slowed down". Always was intense throughout the movie."
"I loved it. The only thing that I didn't like was the leadership of Gamora."
"This really lived up to my expectations. This I guess you could say "climax" to the MCU is an awesome one. The visual effects and soundtrack were the best I've ever seen in a superhero flick. The writing in incredible although a lot of the comedy seems misplaced especially with Thor. Other than the comedy the film is just... amazing. Mind-blowing. 9.5/10 worth watching twice."
"Wow talk about a cliffhanger! I can't wait for the next Avengers movie."
"It's a great movie!"
"Why did spider man die so sadly I cried at least 7 times"
"Marvel at it's best !!!! what's not to like about the Avenger's movies and the stellar acting and scripts."
"great fun one of my favourite movies of all time."
"Extremely exciting thrilling and brings all of the heros together perfectly."
"One of the best superheroes film I've ever seen"
"One of the best marvel movies yet!"
"Avengers Infinity War es el esperado resultado y mï¿½s de 20 pelï¿½culas interconectadas. Un crossover espectacular que reune a casi todos los superhï¿½roes del UCM formando una historia de manera natural con un villano impecable ademï¿½s con principios con uno de los finales mï¿½s fuertes en el cine de acciï¿½n. Realmente da ganas de ver la siguiente parte donde tendrï¿½n los hï¿½roes que intentar vencer al villano mï¿½s formidable de Marvel Studios Thanos."
"Incredibly well done. All the characters have an important role to play even though there are about 24. You donï¿½ 1/2 1/2(TM)t need to watch any of the other films to understand those charactersï¿½ 1/2 1/2(TM) motivations and the ending is one that no one was expecting. 10/10"
"It did a great job of creativity humor script action and including all the marvel characters."
"The best movie in the histoy :v"
"a "I came into this movie expecting a lot and I was not disappointed. In fact it exceeded my expectations by far. Best superhero movie of all time."
"Engaging throughout. Reduced points because the long awaited reunion between Tony and Steve did not happen here and that the attempts to make viewers empathise with Thanos really was a miss for me. I was expecting him to be more intelligent and yet this guy just simply thinks the only solution to overpopulation is mass murder. Would recommend this guy to go back to school instead of moping around and murdering people randomly.I walked in with a blank slate so I certainly did not expect an Avengers movie to be a tear-jerker. Definitely left a deep impression within me. Most importantly it handled the massive amount of characters with finesse. Russo Brothers angst always gets me. Well done. Cant wait for the next installment"
"I didn't enjoy crying while watching Spider-man disintegrate. That said imma need to see peter paker and shuri meet up in Avengers 4."
"The film is fun to watch but the story feels like doesn't need to be split into two movies"
"The hype for Infinity War was unreal and Marvel delivered. You've got 30 characters that gotta have at least some level of spotlight and they manage to give each and every single one of them their fair share."
"Epic from start to finish. Absolutely gripping."
"The best movie ive ever seen. This is a movie with surprise sadness and some of the best action of all time. This is a must see and will always be remembered in movie history"
"Very well made easily one of the best MCU movies. The action is amazing the characters are great and the plot is very well structured. But the best thing with this movie to me is Thanos. There is so much depth to his character. The movie can feel a little bit messy and unfocused at times because of so many characters but overall they did a very good on it!"
"This movie was absolutely amazing. It had me jumping up and cheering throughout the whole film. This next little bit is a spoiler but before the movie started I yelled out black panther dies! Because I didn't think it would happen and then it did happen so expect the unexpected. Quills line: "oh man" is exactly how I felt throughout the whole movie. The fights were the best I've seen in these movies as well. Well worth the watch and the wait"
"I think I'm the only one who hasn't drunk the Kool Aid. I really don't understand the appeal of these films. I guess they are good comic book movies if all you want is the depth and substance of C grade comic book. All the jokey banter two dimensional characters over the top action sequences simplistic villains poor CGI and formula writing is great if you're 13 or younger but these aren't the films to watch if you want any real depth or quality story."
"Shocking and undefeatably the best one without doubt."
"A fun action packed film with good to brilliant performances assembled over 10 years of monumental historic film making that is neither flawless or an anticlimax as it lives up to the hype definitely worth watching despite a bombardment of characters and action."
"Full of non-stop fast-paced action that features nearly all of the heroes we've seen so far in the Marvel movies there's no shortage of excitement to get the blood flowing as they come together to fight the big bad guy (as well as his interesting and creepy right-hand man) who's been pulling all the strings. There's some real demonstration of powers going on here. And that's great it really is. The problem is that's almost all there is. It pretty much opens with an action sequence and doesn't ever stop. As a consequence there's a lack of character development and quieter more dramatic moments to anchor the film and let you catch your breath. I hesitate to say it's action overload (but it's action overload) but the effect is somewhat numbing where each fight has less of an impact than the last. Now that's not to say there aren't any dramatic scenes at all and it's the few that do exist such as those exploring Thanos as a person that are the most powerful and impactful. That being said it's all been building towards this moment and they had to fit a ridiculous amount of events locations and people into one film -- with that in mind it's amazing they managed to not make a complete mess of it let alone make something that's this entertaining."
"Wooow love ï¿½ 1/2'ï¿½?"
"Honestly these films just keep getting worse & worse and this was the most mediocre and chaotic one yet!"
"A fantastic film featuring (except for Ant-Man and Hawkeye) all the heroes in the MCU with a daring ending leaving fans wanting to know what will happen next."
"This movie was a great chapter for the entire MCU. The story action and special effects were great. Thanos is now one of my favorite villains. 10/10"
"best movie ever can't what for the 4 part"
"Incredible nailbiting experience to watch this masterpiece unfold. Even though I can't recommend this to anyone that haven't watched 2 or more Marvel Movies in the entirety."
"I a really surprised that this movie has such a low percentage in my perspective it is a awesome because it is the best marvel universes against one the most powerful beings."thin excuse for mindless repetitive violence"
"amazing film great cast awsome fights"
"Excellent cinematography and an amazingly cohesive story despite all of its characters. The film takes risks with its storytelling and ending and features an incredibly compelling villain with an amazing mo-cap performance behind it and a stellar character arc. The film feels epic in all the right ways and is very satisfying in its action humor and story."
"This was one amazing movie."
""Avengers: Infinity War" somehow manages to handle its humongous cast of characters and makes it feel as though they all have equal amounts of screen time even in a film starring the bad guy. With laughs tears and action galore this film is worth a watch whether you're a casual viewer or a hardcore fan of the MCU."
"BEST MOVIE OF 2018!!!"
"dark depressing ambiguous"
"Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo soooooooooooooooo good!!!!!!"
"Great movie kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time and has a surprising ending."
"Great characters and the ability to construct a movie where they all fit in is very impressive."
"To be honest i am disappointed. I was so curious about seing this movie. I even went in the Premiere of it and after it i was like yeah that was not that i expected. Didnï¿½t have the Wow-Factor i had in previous Marvel-Movies. They built this whole universe with more than 15 movies which all introduce the Infinity Stones etc. and then they put the Soul Stone on a random Planet. Why?! For me this was one of the biggest Disappointings in the MCU."
"This movie was very exceptional very beautiful and vividly directed and orchestrated with good music and cinematography. If anything it deserves higher ratings than previous Marvel movies! It grasped emotions and humour and all that blended very well within the film. It was truly remarkable."
"A very good film. Entertaining and funny at the same time."
"Loki died too early and death wasn't in it - but other than that the movie was great."
"As a Marvel geek it was hard not to like the plot. A little diferent from what was expected from Thanos (on his emotional side). but ended up on creating a great story."
"OH THIS WAS A great movie. All the heroes we love coming together to beat a purple man that wants to kill half the universe. And seriously 84 percent Rotten tomatoes. um oh wait I can't say that to rotten tomatoes no no NO ... uh Rotten Tomatoes I don't feel so good..."
"with a surprising and new ending Avengers Infinity War manages to be one of the best MCU films and not to mention the performances and the creativity of joining all our beloved heroes in a story"
"It feels very much like a first part but Infinity War still offers some dazzling spectacle and further character developments."
"Loved it! It followed closely the comic which is what we all should be seeing in every movie! This should be used as a template for every marvel movie from here on out! We want to see live action versions of what we've all read in comics!"
"Cathy my wife sees this as a big disjointed film. This is what the mini-series looks like in live action. This is how an ensemble film works. This is how to balance a film full of colorful characters that have distinctive individual voices. Can't wait for the sequel and resolution!"
"An exceptional well-paced masterpiece that has us leaving the theater in tears. Excitedly awaiting the second part to this movie. However the relationship of Scarlet Witch and vision is underdeveloped while in the comics. Should have worked a bit more on it."
"so ... the ending was not was i could predict and that could be a good point but i cant find an answer for this question : why ? what was the only way of doctor strange way of winning ? so we learn that if all the heroes come together they can do nothing ? all this budget  hard work beautiful scenes  breathtaking fights for loosing ? why ?"
"This movie was so good. It will be studied in film school I am certain of this."
"Right in amazing spider-man in infinity war ending of infinity war is heart breaking tom Holland was epic it's a 100% certified fresh"
"Best 20 movies ever!"
"Up there with the best of the MCU films and has some incredibly moving moments to go along with the amazing action and fight scenes. Even though many of the things that happen won't stick it is still a bit shocking they had the guts to do it. One scene in particular will haunt me forever (Mr. Stark I don't feel good)."
"Como siempre Marvel asombrandonos con uno de los mejores villanos de Marvel"
"10 years of build-up to an absolutely amazing movie."
"One of my favorite movies of all time! Epic great characters and real consequences that shake up the universe. Cannot wait for Avengers 4."
"Great movie great start to a huge mashup of MCU heroes!"
"Is the Marvel franchise growing stale or was this movie just lackluster? This movie suffered from being a Part 1 with no real conclusion. Its a slight disappointment from what was supposed to be a build up of 10 years worth of marvel movies.Get the full review on our podcast Dysfunctional Nerdcast available on all podcast directories. We also offer celebrity interviews along with all pop culture news including comics toys movies conventions and more."
"This could have been so much better if the villain actually had a motive."
"I have never been more interested in what happens next than I was for this movie."
"Avengers: Infinity War just might be Marvel's greatest achievement yet. Somehow balancing a bunch of characters perfectly giving us Marvel's best villain with Thanos and gives us the spectacle we've been waiting for and much more.10/10"
"it ws the most badinst thing ever"
"Is this the best marvel could think of. Infinity war is one of the most predictable movies I've ever seen. Even the part where Gamora dies straight boring."
"Avengers: Infinity War is aptly named as most of its runtime is the defining battle against Thanos and while that's exactly what audiences were expecting the movie feels incomplete. Asides from the agonizing yearning for more Infinity War is one of the best Marvel produced in ages. There's no dull moment for every minute is action-packed and the few scenes that aren't are emotionally resonant. Zoe Saldana's brilliant performance made Gamora's story a lot more touching than it needed to be. In fact the entire cast truly outdid themselves and gave it their all. As the culmination of a 1o year journey approaches the upcoming Avengers movie could be the ultimate MCU blockbuster topping even this one."
"Una pelicula sobrevalorada Que no entiendes a menos que te veas todo el ucm Es una total perdida de tiempo y en serio... Esta pelicula es innecesaria ya que mueren casi todos y ya sabemos que en avengers 4 volveran.. Una decepciï¿½n"
"It was kind of a mixed feeling at the end! But can't wait for second part! And so much action many tears to!"
"This was an action packed movie that really delivered"
"10 years of creating diverse universe finally pays off. Marvel adopts darker tone and uses it correctly (unlike DCEU). There are at least 3 things that made this installment interesting for me:1. Making Thanos main character (at least in his own eyes) and charismatic villain (unlike most of other MCU villains)2. Smart decision to split characters into a few groups - it provides enough screen time for each one without overabundance plus creates interesting interactions3. Amazing score. Alan Silvestri is at his best plus they incorporated the most memorable themes from the other MCU movies (Black Panther The First Avenger The Avengers Guardians).The only problem with Infinity War is that it would be very hard for Marvel to top that."
"Great addition to a stunningly unviverse so perfectly crafted. This is story telling at its finest"
"Greatest movie ice ever seen in my life it blew me away"
"Sooooooooooooooooooooooooo did live up to the hype in every damn way possible. Enuf said."
"Avengers infinity war had the daunting task of concluding an era of the Marvel cinematic universe (MCU) that has been ten years in the making. Joe and Anthony Russo were given the keys to Marvels most ambitious project to date; they had to figure out how over 18 characters from various corners of the MCU would be given adequate screen time in a two an a half hour movie. The Russo brothers delivered! Not only were they able to present these characters true to their solo films; they were able to create new dynamics between some of our favourites. The screen time was limited but when on screen everyone's performances stood out. Some of the stand outs were Chris Hemsworth (thor) Zoe Zeldana (Gamora) and Robert Downey junior (Tony Stark). Zeldana in particular was able to flesh out her character and provide some very emotional scenes that allowed us to understand her character as more then the most lethal assassin in the galaxy. The film was able to juggle multiple storylines that came to a climactic finish; each story played a role in manipulating our emotions whether it be a feeling of redemption with Thor revenge with iron man or passion with Peter quill. This movie hits all the common beats that are expected in a marvel movies. Humour is used excellently throughout the film especially with Dave Bautista (Drax) although I felt he was over done in Guardians of the Galaxy vol 2 he was back to form for this outing. Humour in marvel movies have been somewhat of an issue for me; but with only few gripes in this film I can't complain. With many Marvel movies It's difficult to believe in the stakes Marvel has films slated for years and years which doesn't allow the viewer to believe in a self contained story. The next phase of films have been kept under wraps by Marvel so the viewer is left blind and the emotional weight of character deaths can be felt in this film. Marvel has to make some of the important character deaths permanent or those loose stakes will forever be gone. Finally the most outstanding performance was by the protagonist of the film Thanos (Josh Brolin). Of course I don't believe Thanos is the hero of this film but the Russo's do an incredible job of finding balance (haha) in the complex character that is Thanos. Every great villain believes that they are the good guy Thanos is the prime example and it's executed perfectly. There are hints that the motives of Thanos may not be as well intentioned as he convinces himself they are. Loki (Tom Hiddleston) before he is gruesomely killed by Thanos states "you will never be a god" which could infer more to what Thanos truly wants compared to balancing the universe. Ultimately there isn't a lot of negative criticisms that can be said about Avengers infinity war. The stakes were high and the Russo's were expected to deliver impossible and they did. The film is steadily becoming one of my favourite MCU films but hasn't made the jump to one of my favourite films in general. cannot wait until May 2019."
"Marvels modern day Empire Strike Back!"
"Fantastic MovieNow Waiting for Phase 4  #Marvel#The Avengers"
"I am a Marvel nut and this third installment of Avengers really ties in with all the other Marvel movies and characters into one epic movie to showcase this Marvel universe. Loved how the Guardians of the Galaxy were introduced to it and most of my favorite characters had their parts and key scenes. Would have liked to seen more of the Hulk though! CGI is fantastic as to be expected. Oh and it will continue to another part so it is more of a part 1 of 2 parts? Anyway looking forward to it!"
"A unique movie that requires the viewing of 19 previous movies made in the past ten years. But assuming you have endure the marathon the payoff is hugely satisfying. Or will be?"
"Pretty good start to what should continue to be an extreme climax with the Avengers and the Gurdians of the Galaxy. Thanos has finally stepped in to capture what is rightfully his: The six Infinity Stones. He isn't too bad of a villan so far more like so-so for now. Not too surprisingly the film involves large-scale fights and action moments not too terribly different from most of the previous films only this time it's obviously the fate of the universe. All-in-all shock ending decent film in the Marvel franchise and "Thanos will return.""
"Avengers: Infinity War is definitely fun but it feels like it's missing something. It wasn't quite dark enough to rock me to my core like Logan. Nor was it funny enough to keep me entertained like GOTG. Overall exciting stuff but I felt it could have been a bit more."
"This Movie could of been better in a number ways but it is still great non the less"
"If you're ever looking for a good cry over your favorite super heroes action and war then this movie is for you. This movie was honestly great as I reflect on it. The heroes fight bravely against Thanoes as they try to stop him from destroying the world. However I felt that at some parts it was boring because it was constant fighting which is natural for a movie about war. Aside from that the movie had captured the war great and left many people including me in tears. Lastly this movie left a lot of suspense that only feeds the Marvel Fandom."
"I love this movie thats it."
"Loved it. Thanos is particularly brilliant. Not your average despot but one with emotion and feeling. Makes good use of every single avenger. Cant wait for the next one."
"very poor writing. the acting was the only good part of this movie. was super excited to watch it but it let me down. abuse was treated as "love" and there were too many cliches to take seriously."
"good movie but so long and complicated i make better movies example my one movie uknown"
"I LOVED this film. After 10 years of making (This meant getting all the characters) it's wondeful. This film had laughable scenes sad scenes and happy scenes. So my review:I FEEL SO GOOD!"
""Avengers Infinity War" is one of the "M.C.U.'s greatest sit back and I will tell you a tale of whoa!In an already perfect Franchise after "Black Panther" was released the most anticipated movie of the year was released and lived up to the hype. Fans everywhere enjoyed this flick including people who were new to the "Marvel Cinematic Universe". Then the ending came we lost so much including Black Panther Star Lord Groot Bucky Mantis Drax Loki Gamora Heimdall Vision Wanda Maximoff Doctor Strange and Spider Man. It made everyone cry. So in conclusion "Avengers Infinity War" is the proudest point to the "Marvel Cinematic Universe" we even got Red Skull back."
".After years of introducting each character with their stand alone films expertly brings them all together in a film with a great blend of humor. marvelous special effects and action. for the first part it truly is a spectacular ride. cant wait for part 2."
"This event has a lot of emotions that you won't forgive.It's awesome and the characters are great.Marvel did it again"
"chevere faltaron los DEFENDERS Y THE PUNISHER"
"Best avengers movie. I love both Thor and Captain America with their fresh new look in here (well not really new look for Thor since he cut it in Ragnarok)."
"THanos main role this film Vfx gretDirection super Ironman thor ??Only dissapointing iam hulk fan hulk not comingIm biggest hulk fan"
"Infinity War has probably everything i wanted in a movie: greatly developed characters tough decisions strong and complicated relationships iconic moments and intense fight scenes. Something really amazing."
"honestly it was outstanding"
"This is amazing one of the best movies of all time. I think this because of the amazing characterisation of all characters. Also the desperation of the team is shown. Also Josh Brolin's Thanos is one of the best movie villains of all time. Those complainng abiout the over masculinity is unfair as that's how it is in the comics Marvel can't just invent female character to shoe horn in. Also Scarlett Witch and Gamora (two girls) have some of most screentime. The CGI is also flawless Thanos has the most screentime in the movie but still looks amazing as does the Black Order. It is the MCU#s best movie. And narrative master piece."
"epic action fun and containing everything that we love about the MCU the best MCU movie by far"
"Marvel always leaves me surprised but there is something missing from this movie as a little more development in the characters like Spider man Falcon. Gamora."
"Aquï¿½ tenemos una de las mejores pelï¿½culas de la historia"
"Visually stunning... worth seeing in the theater!"
"I admit that the ending took me in a war of confusion but after watching the film again on my 2nd random movie night at the theaters and was AMAZED!"
"The Best Movie of the Year Super Awesome movie of all times i really Love that Great film."
"can't believe its coming to an end! bit fast paced to get everything in but the fact they've managed to get as much of the cast together as possible i can't wait for the final one"
"I'm still confused about a lot of things. I'm glad this is just part 1 because the ending was terrible. That said I'm not sure if anyone who likes movies as much as I do could get away without seeing this one. It's fun and action-packed and cinematic and worth seeing."
"Must see even if you haven't watched the other MCU films. Spectacle nothing bad to say about it. Leaves you thinking and demanding for the next film."
"my favorite marvel movie"
"Another popcorn action in which the almighty villain wants to destroy the Earth for no reason. Special effects please the eye but the brain gets tired of the lack of talent of the script."
"A perfect second climax to the MCU that brings all of the characters that we've come to love together."
"I love the way they introduced Thanos and gamora. It has hard emotinal punch. Whenever you are talking when Spider Man turns into dust and gamora. This is amazing movie I would like to watch over and over again"
"me encantan los efectos especiales me encantan los vestuarios asi como la histoia que cuenta y su desarrollo la banda sonora es excelente acorde a la situacion  mi favorita siendo cuando Thanos lanza a Gamora por ese precipicio el inesperado regreso de red skull me sorprendio asi como el stormbreaker la nueva arma de Thor los guiï¿½os y cameos tanto al comic como a cosas de la cultura pop. Pero... Es demasiado sencillo quitarle el guantelete del infinito a Thanos Dr Strange pudo haberselo quitado con uno de los portales si peter queel o Starlord no hubiera interferido le habrian quitado a Thanos el guantelete sin problema. Aun teniendo sus erroes debo admititr que la pelicula me encanto."
"I have seen this movie at least a dozen times now and I still enjoy it! I have had very few experiences in a theater like I had when I saw Infinity War. The humor the action the hoping the heroes would win but knowing they wouldn't and the utter shock at the level of loss at the end. I know some think this was just a cash-grab maybe it was but in the end it was a cause I still would give my money to!"
"Definitely the best movie of the MCU don't care what the critics say. I love how they unite the entire cast and Josh Brolin was born to play Thanos."
"WOW1 i was stunned at this action packed epic and dint see that ending coming"
"One of my favorite movies of all time the Russos did a great job withe the screen time and even though it has a lot of characters it doesn't feel like it is an overstuffed movie"
"amazing unexpected the ending left wanting the next avengers movie"
"Complete success. I watched it like five times in two days."
"WOW this movie blew me away. I wanted this movie to be great and they exceeded my expectations"
"Pretty Good Russo Brothers!"
"This movie is a perfect blend of character development and action. Personally I thought it was going to flop. I was wrong another quality movie by marvel."
"Without a doubt the best movie of 2018 11/10 would reccomend and see again"
"The movie is entertaining funny action-packed and with a really thoughtful backstory. Absolutely incredible."
"Avengers infinity war marks yet another fast paced exciting adventure in the marvel cinematic universe. Between it's emotionally moving story and how well balanced the characters are this movie is great"
"Despite the lengthy runtime I couldn't help but feel that it wasn't long enough."
"Love this movie it's different than all other mcu movies and the shots are just beautiful."
"I am writing this many months on from having watched the film.... 4 times in 5 days mind you though when I did. I am still staggered by the movie. I had grand concerns that the film would be unable to meet my lofty expectations. Expectations that have been built up over the course of a decade and several top-quality films in the MCU franchise......well let me assure you these expectations were well and truly met and in some respects exceeded.Infinity War was an extravaganza. An orgy of action a veritable buffet of drama and a total leg slapper. Some Marvel/Disney films have been slated for their very "Disney" feel but somehow this film manages to escape all that delivering a properly adult film that absolutely caters to the kids in equal measure. I found myself constantly needing to close my mouth such was my ever dropping jaw. The scenes were not only hugely climactic and powerful but the visuals were spectacular and thoroughly engaging.I put all of this down to the Russos. They can walk on water in my humble opinion. They took what could easily have been the most difficult job in cinema right now bringing together this simply massive group of characters and the actors who portray them and serving them up on screen in a symphony of excellence. Some of the pre-release criticism was that the audience would be immediately disconnected as there'd be no true consequence given there was another Avengers instalment due next year. The Russo Brothers managed to dial up the emotion to the proverbial 11 because it certainly had my heart beating and my sympathies flowing. Yes some characters will be brought to life again but its not even about that. The portrayal and direction was such that you still felt all of their pain and the nuanced approach to their ultimate demise was handled with aplomb. Genuinely the best film yet in the MCU followed for me by Captain America: Winter Soldier. No luck there. Russo Brothers again and proving they are easily the best of the MCU film makers.Watch the film as many times as you can. Worth it."
"Arguably the most complete superhero film ever made"
"Amazing film which did a great job bringing together all that the MCU was building up to. Highly recommend that you watch all the Marvel films that came out prior to Infinity War before seeing this film."
"Esta pelï¿½cula es una de las mejores de marvel yo personalmente no encuentro fallos y ni hablar de las actuacione"
"This movie was breathtaking! Incredible"
"Unlike the Lucasfilm branch of Disney which insults fans both cinematicly and in response to critism the Marvel branch thrives on delivering good stories interesting characters and staying as true as they can to the fan base. Having digested this movie for a day now I can honestly say I'm ready to see it again. From the outset I knew I wasn't getting a run of the mill Marvel movie. Thanos was really flushed out well. His motivations were able to be understood. He was human enough to be relatable. What I loved the most was the bad guy won. Heroes died. The bold direction taken with charcters some loved some didn't and some were like meh about was as well done as one could when involving so many characters at once. I applaud Marvel for subverting us well with respect to the characters and fans unlike some directors I won't mention. Ruin Johnson."
"WTF?? The dumbest movie OF THE YEAR!"
"The death scenes were so bad I laughed"
"Amazingly coherent for what it was... and while it didn't all make sense (just yet) I'm hopeful that once part two comes out this movie will see be as entertaining and re-watchable as it's been so far."
"Issa good movie my guys"
"The most entertaining Marvel movie I've ever seen. I couldn't wait to see this movie and it didn't let me down. Everyone was worried how they'd manage to put so many characters in the movie and not make it confusing or cluttered and they handled it great."
"Still not emotionally stable from this movie. Loved every part of it...apart from the first five minutes ;( RIP Loki <3"
"High paced funny and has the ultimate ensemble cast - really fun to watch."
"Simplemente perfecta"
"Favourite film ever can't wait for avengers 4."
"brilliant film it kept me gripped throughout can watch this film over and over again"
"5 stars nothing more to say except ditto"
"Better than I thought it would be but it's missing Adam Warlock which is kind of like having a Batman movie without Batman."
"A masterpiece for the ages"
"Good special effects and fun fight scenes but with a plot spread so thin even death carries no emotional weight."
"Great movie. Can't wait to see part 2."
"Good film very interesting"
"I love the movie so much but part of the line its ughhh to much nerd but fine.... i love thanos so much he was great and scary and i get it he think he gonna fix the world and he does so great movie very nice"
"Great story telling and an epic way to bring together the entire MCU (with the exception of Ant Man and Hawkeye). Although the ending will always be a heart wrenching thing to watch and a first for Marvel to have the hero's lose it was actually nice for a change. Can't wait for A4!"
"Honestly I thought this movie lived up to the hype very well. I was impressed at how well the whole film held together as a whole. And Josh Brolin as Thanos is one of if not the best villains in the entire MCU."
"Surprisingly good. It (mostly) manages to balance its many characters and storylines competently."
"good movie bad ending"
"the best movie of marvel studios. but i dont like the final. the only thing a can say of the end is WTF!"
"This movie was awesome.I watched it 7 times and still enjoyed it."
"Want to see this so baaaaaaaaaddddddd"
"Infinity War is a wildly ambitious and entertaining ride. For the first 90 minutes it pulls it off. However i was bored in the last 60 minutes.It's very funny and many of the characters are on good form. Thanos is an intimidating villain cunning and cruel. But like so often with Marvel he does come up short. And blink and you'll miss Black Panther bar the fantastic Wakanda battle Everyone floats away at the end and it will do likewise in my memory."
"This movie is so great the way it manages to juggle so many different plots but still manages to be one of the most entertaining movies that I have seen in the past few years"
"This is the best Marvel movie ever made. Avengers: Infinity war is my favorite Marvel movie my favorite superhero movie my favorite action movie my favorite sci- fi movie my favorite fantasy movie and my 2nd favorite movie of all time. The acting was stupendous especially Josh Brolin as Thanos as well as Robert Downey Jr. Chris Pratt Zoe Saldana Chris Hemsworth Elizabeth Olsen Chris Evans Scarlett Johansson Mark Ruffalo Dave Bautista Pom Klementieff Tom Holland Benedict Cumberbatch Chadwick Boseman Danai Gurira Paul Bettany and Don Cheadle as well as the entire rest of the cast. The action scenes and visual effects were spectacular. The writing story and screenplay play were all fantastic. The emotional weight of the story was beautiful touching and sad I even cried a little when Gamora was killed by Thanos and got teary eyed when Peter Parker/Spider-Man was disappearing. The production of the whole movie was great. The direction in which Anthony and Joe Russo took the movies was amazing. The musical score composed by Alan Silvestri was fantastic. Also I loved Stan Lee's cameo as the bus driver it was perfect. I loved this movie immensely and I can not wait to see the sequel. I hope this wins an Oscar for something like visual effects or the new Best Popular Picture or at the least gets nominated for one. A+."
"To name a few things I enjoyed about the film: most of the scenes with Chris Pratt are entertaining and there are some effective bits of drama throughout the film as well. But overall the film feels bland and the storytelling lacks motivation. I rarely find myself compelled by the plastic plot-driven characters on display. Seriously for the epic scale this film asserts the stakes may be high but if there's no emotion or soul going into its story why should I care what happens? At this point I've kind of lost interest in the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe. I've felt this way many times before and I was caught by surprise with Homecoming and Ragnarok last year but maybe I just find them more enjoyable and satisfying to watch than the darker or more "politically complex" films (think The Winter Soldier and Civil War) which appears to be what Infinity War aims for. Although it's not always a bad thing to put heroes at stake at the hands of a strong Marvel villain it fails to be intriguing. And I know it's not just my having a problem with more serious matters (I love The Dark Knight); Marvel succeeds when it takes a hold of the fact that it's just a movie and it can't half expect its audience to take everything seriously. Just look at the overwrought technology and downright complexity of its universe which may fascinate some but only bores me. All in all Infinity War is one of Marvel's most ambitious feats but is still nothing short of a disappointment."
"One of the best MCU film I have watched"
"It was decent don't understand the hype in fact I think the hype and the spoiler for spiderman's death ruined. Oh no everyone is dead ah it's ok they'll be back next movie. ??"
"4th time watching it"
"A truly amazing movie Marvel pulled of something truly unique with this film. It is by far my favourite Marvel movie. This movie has done things others were to afraid to do and by doing so it succeeds in almost every way."
"An Epic saga to conclude the first 10 years of the MCU"
"The Russo brother nailed it. With a spectacular ending great action sequences and a remarkable villain this movie is easily the best movie of the year."
"This is a great conclusion of 10 years of MCU's development. But I would like to point that the movie was a bit too short what I mean by that is that it should have included some more scenes for the characters that were left out a bit and also to explain some transitions between a scene and another. I know that 150 minutes are a lot but it is still a really big movie I just can't be roughly as long as Captain America Civil War. Also the Russo Brothers were wrong about a thing (using Avengers Infinity War part 1 and part 2 titles)  this kinda looks like an half completed movie but only partly. Besides all of this it definitely is (at least) better than Avengers 2."
"It wasn't the best of the MCU but still very good"
"Not bad full of? action but also have a lot of hole in the story in my opinion"
"Although ambitious Avengers: Infinity War's overloaded cast make the multiple storylines hard to follow."
"The Marvel Universe unites in Avengers: Infinity War an epic action-packed adventure. When the Mad Titan Thanos comes to Earth to collect the last Infinity Stone the Avengers assemble and wage a desperate battle to save the universe from Thanos' plans for mass genocide. The film does an extraordinary job at bringing together all of the different Marvel characters and teams them up in interesting ways. And the chases and fight scenes are incredibly exciting and well-choreographed. The special effects and the CGI are also really good (with the exception of the disintegration effects). However the plot is weak and ends rather abruptly. Additionally Thanos proves to be a fairly generic villain and a little too all-powerful. Yet despite a few weaknesses Avengers: Infinity War is an unparalleled cinematic event (the culmination of ten years of filmmaking) that has a remarkably ambitious vision."
"A spectacular movie that lives up to the hype and actually delivers a villain worthy of the culmination of the MCU thus far. In a 2.5-hour film some scenes can be a little slow and with the largest ensemble cast to date some of our primary heroes don't get as much screen time as they deserve; but the humor action and heart all perfectly balanced in this high-stakes story will leave you entertained and hungry for the next installment."
"Watching this a second time didn't alter my feelings about it. I like it. I don't think it's amazing but it does what it should do. What I think is interesting about it is that it highlights very clearly what the current Marvel films do well and why they tend to be divisive. What Disney has done partly through acquiring the license to so many characters but also through a lot of diligence is really capture on film a lot of what is enjoyable about comic books ... the large world full of interrelated characters who appear in each other stories and build up a shared lore over the years. This is the kind of thing you expect TV to do well but not movies given the expense and long time frames so it's fascinating to see this form of serial storytelling really working. This film in particular feels more like a big even series of comics than a film. It tells a big story full of characters in a more episodic structure and just assumes you know who all the characters are and understand the backstory that has accumulated over the last few years. I think this is fascinating and points towards the potential of telling different kinds of stories on film. It's also a film that is bound to frustrate anyone expecting it to have a normal act structure and character development."
"For as many characters and story-lines it has it does well juggling them all. Marval fans can feel satisfied about this film."
"This movie is perfect for me."
"I applaud the work done by the Russo brothers10 years of waiting have been worth it."
"This movie is an A+  10/10. The Russos did a great job. The Highlight of the year so far."
"The king of expectation subversion. Marvel's outdone themelves this time!"
"With a massive cast an incredibly well done villain and plenty of action and humor to make it worth while Infinity War uses its time and cinematography to everyone's expectations."
"this movie is the best"
"In this one the "Good guys" don't win and the worlds is almost completely destroyed but one metal handed villain. Incredible acting and plot twist in the movie up to the credits. Is this the first times the heroes didn't win ? and will this ever happen again."
"Spiderman dies 10/10"
"This was jam pack with fun action humor and the end was suprising."
"A satifsying amount of action story and characters they did an excellent job pushing so many characters into one story and still come off successful however there is no growth in any character which is to be expected which makes it thoroughly dependant on the storyline...some scenes did fall flat but all in all  a movie well played"
"what can i say I loved it. But I should for 200000000"
"This is the best marvel movie and the best movie other than Teen Titans GO! To The Movies. It has cool action awesome humour and some mega cool characters!!!"
"absolutely scrumptious."
"Totally epic. Amazing movie."
"It was a masterpiece"
"10.1.18 library dvd @ home w/Sh"
"It's a great movie you should see it even if you haven't"
"Quite possibly one of if not the best Marvel films. Juggles multiple story arcs incredibly well with a good dose of entertaining sometimes slightly forced humor. The only complaint being to fully understand the film you must have done your research on the previous films and the meaningless superhero films with no purpose are not my cup of tea however I was pleased to find that Thanos is a 10/10 villian who introduces topics relevant and thought provoking wrapped in a fun super powered package."
"AInfinity War is exactly the kind of film that delivers on a 10 year promise from its studio. It's a culmination of everything built up from the original Iron Man and it's Marvel's finest product to date. It's hilarious perfectly blended and has just the right amount of darkness to give every audience member something special to remember."
"it is the best movie i have ever seen i love the battles and i loved the villain his cause was understandable and i liked that he would do anything to get all the stones"
"Perfect in all aspects"
"Highly engaging great performance delivered over a highly loaded storyline with more subplots then a normal Marvel movie of any kind! It was a hard one to pull of but they did it. I look forward to the 2nd part fo this 2 parter given its main storyline's ending setting up the part 2. Its a must see for a Marvel fan and entertaining for just about anyone else who remotely likes Sci Fi or Fantasy genres of movie making."
"Awesome f**king movie very emotional at the end still wish they didn't kill Spider-man. R.I.P. Peter Parker and many others."
"awesome!! waiting for the next one"
"It was definitely hyped up way too much and really disappointing. It's like they tried to pack as much CGI into the movie as they possibly could and it's got so much action it just gets really boring. The last movies were much better than this... And some scenes are so bright it hurts my eyes."
"The biggest and best crossover movie to date. Thanks Marvel"
"This movie had everything you want. The action scenes were amazing The CGI was very realistic and the tension and drama in this movie was acted out great. Josh Brolin did amazing as the Mad Titan Thanos."
"Everything about this movie was fantastic. The way they made Thanos look and how it was HIS movie was incredible. The sheer hopelessness of the Avengers and how desperate they are in this movie shows how great of a villain Thanos is."
"MCU. Excellent as always"
"Movie was not perfect but was a lot of fun and was different from the other marvel movies. This movie took many risks and was not afraid to end in such a dark tone. Surprised me and really built up the tension that was needed for this film. Easily one of my favorite marvel movies."
"I slow played Civil War.. this is *just* like that."
"I enjoyed most of it but guardians of the galaxy should have never been included. The attempt at comedy on their part was a buzz kill."
"Its sooooooo good . Everything ranging from acting  directing  story plot points color scheme music theme gr8 villian character arcs is perfectly done. Can't wait for yet untitled avengers 4."
"wish dr strange uses the time stone more..."
"An insanely fun and action-packed movie that brings together a large band of MCU heroes against one transcendent villain who proves to be one of MCU's best antagonists."
"This movie had far too much going on to be considered enjoyable for anyone who isn't a Marvel nerd. The core concept at work (Thanos' reasoning for his destruction of peoples and planets) is somewhat intriguing but not very well developed. The ending is somewhat surprising and abrupt. Sequel in the works?"
"Man that scene with Spider-man tho"
"Loved it. Great setup for Avengers 4. Can't wait"
"This was one of the greatest mcu films of all time it gave rocket a story ark and I'm not even SURE what side I'm on!"
"An amazing watch. one of the best marvel movies to date. though it is genuinely heart breaking it is just awe inspiring."
"it makes me feel a gamut of emotions"
"Best Avengers movie yet! Didn't feel as long as it was. Kept my attention."
"Its a awesome movie!!!!!!!!! i love it"
"A beautiful movie packed with many beautiful memes"
"Overall i Think That you Will have a good time watching this movie but That doesn't mean That it doesn't have flaws"
"This film crams in so many different characters that they don't seem to have much space left for plot or the comedic whit that at least was present in the original. It also again goes for the ridiculous massive final battle with an alien force fought largely through hand-to-hand combat."
"One of the most visually-stunning movies in the MCU but struggles to find sincerity with so many characters in another predictable narrative structure."
"Is there anything Josh Brolin can't do? Trailer park cowboy President of the US genocidal purple tyrant he is amazing! I loved this movie I saw Ant Man/Wasp first but after watching this movie the end of the former made much more sense!"
"Watch this...SPOILER AHEAD...SPOILER AHEAD!Even if it only ends where the comic book event started...Otherwise great popcorn flick...Thanos is strangely likeable as a genocidal lunatic (even if he is weirdly overpowered...c'mon Dr. Strange...you control the Time Stone...and you can't see how to beat him?) and all your Superhero favorites have their part to play. Spiderman (in a film better than any of the Spiderman 3 / Amazing Spiderman movies) and Ironman (by FAR at his best since the original Ironaman) meet the Guardians of the Galaxy (Wait do they?) and Peter Dinkledge is killer as always with a twist.Watch it...great popcorn film."
"Best Marvel Movie!!!!"
"This movie is the coming together of over 18 movies 10 years to this one movie. You can't even really say anything about this movie but if you have not seen it then go see it right now. This is definely an event movie and will never forget seeing this opening night in the theater full of other people."
"It was an emotional rollercoaster! So awesome amazing fights fantastic story long awaited questions answered just plain marvel awesome! On the edge of my seat many times gasped rebeatly and pleasantly surprised I laughed a lot too!! Go and see this master piece of a huge diverse jaw widening movie. So annoyed I gotta wait for the 4th movie a whole year away?? overall WATCH IT!!!!!"
"It's a great movie but CAN BE BETTER STILL"
"This movie is simply epic: great story well rendered plot and amazing visual effects. Figuratively can be seen as the eternal fight of all beings against the Destiny. Someone thinks we live in a universe with rules which cannot be broken because they define the reality itself others think instead that life can be perceived in new ways going beyond those rules. And so here it is the conflict nay an interior conflict of the dark hero Thanos obsessed with knowledge. I repeat myself: it is an epic story present in everyone's life."
"It was a good movie nothing to special . Definitely over-hyped. If you have not seen the movies before this one you have to watch it to understand what is going on. I had the watched all the movies that came before it but it I was still confused sometimes so I had to re-watch the previous movies and then watch it. Overall good movie but nothing special about it except for the fact they finally got almost every character in the movie."
"This movie has got me so hyped up that I have seen every single Marvel movie 3 times. I can't wait to see how Tony Stark brings back the dusted characters."
"If you haven't heard about this movie welcome to earth and this is one you will want to see and own. Great job MCU"
"Jaw-dropping twists emotional roller-coaster dreams coming true for fans spectacular visuals and several heroic moments."
"This is "the" movie of 2018. not that steaming pile of sh1t called tlj."
"to me this movie is one the greatest movies of all time but this is just how i think cant with for the next one.and i dont understand why it hase 84% it should be over 90%"
"As an OG fan of Marvel who has followed their journey since the very first movie Iron Man 1 I would say that Russo brothers and all the actors have done such a brilliant job at creating a multi-layered multi-character and emotionally resounding superhero opera. There's nothing such as a perfect movie but it is probably close to the best movie it could have been.My favorite Marvel's character has always been Captain America but in this movie I have to give a big round of applause to the mighty Thor. Unmoored early in Infinity War Thor no longer simply faces the question of his place as a hero but his place as a god. Thor has been torn apart and left as a broken thing who must now struggle to redefine and forge a new family to replace the one he lost. When Thor himself holds open the iris of Eitri's forge it's the birth of a true hero forged in pain and sacrifice delivering one hell of a satisfying blow with a brand new ax of justice. Thor's teary-eyed confession to Rocket in which he discusses all of things he's lost is one of Infinity War's best scenes and affords the character a sincerity that Hemsworth has rarely had the chance to play.Overall great scope action team-ups twists and style/direction the franchise is being taken delivering upon the hype needed for such a massive event of a film needed to be seen on the big screen. And I can't wait to see mysteries unfolded in the upcoming Avengers 4."
"A great cinematic feast. The Russos pulled it off everything was just great."
"Avengers: Infinity War is an amazing gathering of all the greatest heroes to fight their gravest threat yet! It's a great film with a great story and screenplay written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely who are common MCU writers. It contains great performances from the whole cast who all do an amazing job with their roles! It's a great achievement for 10 years of the MCU. The Russo Brothers who are common MCU directors do a great job directing and they make it look great. Basically every hero in the MCU teaming up is something we've all wanted to see for a very long time. The film is something that tons of fans love and will for sure keep the coming for the next films to come!"
"This film is an amazing once in a lifetime experience. If u haven't seen it then what the hell r u doing"
"The best movie of marvel. And it is very passionate is judt the best if you just see the comics"
"The best Avengers movie and also the best Blockbuster in several years. A way better than all recent superhero movies."
"Superb culmination of the last then years of MCU that will leave you speechless at the very end. The cast is superb as usual with each actor playing their characters at their usual best. The standout is Josh Brolin as Thanos who combined with some brilliant performance capture crafts the MCU's best villain to date. Even though his plan is monstrous (and based on the stupid overpopulation myth) you understand his motives and even feel for him at the lengths his is willing to go to accomplish his mission (which are horrifying). Behind the camera the Russos manage to balance the numerous characters and plot lines into an exciting epic bouncing from New York to Wakanda to even outer space. They match up the characters perfectly from Iron Man & Dr. Strange to Rocket & Thor giving the right level of heart between the epic action which sets a new standard for blockbuster movies. Simply put the kind of movie that willl satisfy MCU fans and leave you clamoring for the next Avengers film."
"A film the fans deserved. Absolutely incredible play and direction and exceeded all expectations. Surprisingly despite covering so many characters all had a suitable amount of screen time!"
"a true tearjerker greatest marvel movie yet"
"Disappointing and obvious plot line."
"Wasn't the best Marvel movie I've watched so far but definitely entertaining!"
"Can't believe how this is ending"
"Finally! This was movie getting after every scene. I was disappointed at 2 jokes. Overall the movie is perfect. Not gonna say flawless but perfect."
"The beginning of the end of the current phase of Marvel films also brings about one of the best MCU films yet.With the fate of the universe at stake the tone is considerably darker than most other MCU films but despite this the film still delivers the typical Marvel humour particularly when it comes to Thor Rocket and Groot.One of my biggest fears in the run-up to the release of Infinity War was that with such a huge cast some of the characters would get side-lined but thankfully that wasn't the case with only Mantis and Shuri feeling like supporting characters. But who cares about Mantis anyway? Josh Brolin as Thanos is the films biggest highlight though. Despite being the villain he's the central character to the film and is written in such a way that despite being a genocidal maniac it's hard not to see where he's coming from. Brolin really is excellent in the role and is not only the best MCU villain he's one of the best villains in a comic book movie rivalling Heath Ledger as the Joker.There are a few places in the middle of the film that do drag a little bit but they are few and far between. It's also fair to say that anyone not invested in the MCU will probably feel lost at times. But for any Marvel fan or someone who just enjoys high stake action films Infinity War is an essential watch."
"the most stupid superhero movie I have ever seen but still fun to watch."
"this is the culmination of everything in this universe for the past ten years"
"Incredible. Simply incredible. Every movie Marvel has made has been terrific but this one's up there for the best of all time."
"Infinity War is a brashly entertaining film structured to show off each character and to give them just enough to do. However is not acknowledged the traffic jam of egos that suffers to go somewhere and makes very little sense. There's almost no pacing in here. It's all sensation and no pulse because everything is big all of the time."
"It was hard not to fall asleep during the many many repetitive scenes throughout the movie. There are probably less than :60 seconds of real (not CGI) scenery in the entire movie and it is very noticeable. The plot is like every scene from CSI: Miami. Thanos is animated like Roger Rabbit in the real world. Pros: I enjoyed seeing Guardians show up and the new Spiderman."
"Real nice film with a great fun and also strong emotions."
"This movie puts you at the edge of your seat and the final we leave you speechless"
"Good movie. Felt like I did when I watched the original Star Wars. Thank you Marvel."
"This is it the wait is finally over. Over 10 years of storytelling and it's finally here. Avengers: Infinity War was a great movie. the effects were for the most part amazing. Thanos looks great. At times Iron Man's armor did look a bit fake but that's nitpicking. Overall it was a great movie and it was definitely worth the wait. The Russo Brothers did a great job."
"Arguably the best movie of the year and one of the best superhero movies ever. The ending is arguably the saddest of the 2000's the snap is so insane that I cried when my favorite character Spider-Man died."
"Marvel has upgraded its movies to a new level with this amazing movie! Although the script does have some plot errors that could have cut down the movie immensely rather than splitting it into two seperate movies. Overall this is a fantastic movie that played with your emotions and left you feeling empty with shock.4.5 stars!"
"It's a packed movie but given the Herculean task of putting together the Marvel universe into one film AND balancing screentime AND providing a worthy foe I can't imagine anyone doing it better! But no you can't just waltz in with zero knowledge of the MCU and expect to know what's going on. And if you haven't watched the other Marvel movies gotta get on that!"
"The movie is beautiful the story when compare to the comics is just a little different and the ending suggests that this war isnt over yet"
"I don't get it. Infinity War is so awesome why the hate?"
"Thor Gamora Star Lord and Scarlet Witch definitely stole the show when they had the chance."
"It was definitely a great movie. Had a bit of character arcs but some decisions made by some characters are so dumb. The action sequences are great though."
"One of the best movies this year. Very well written so many characters and yet everything flowed well."
"Infinity War lives up to expectations and unlike Age of Ultron and Civil War which were mostly filler movies something meaningful actually happens at the end and the heroes are finally put against a great villain who carries the film on his own. Well done."
"Epic movie. Flawless. Left the theater thirsty for more."
"Marvel movies are just micheal bays transformers with jokes. I think infinity war might be one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen. Nothing resembling believability in any second of the film boring dialogue a total excess of forgetable characters. The physics is terribly inconsistent the cgi bad the characters are boring. The action is just like a transformers movie just pointless things moving around. Not only dull but cringeworthy."
"The movie was amazing the actors were fantastic the soundtrack fit the movie perfectly and there were some pretty funny moments in the movie."
Entertaining enough. Maybe the superhero phase has been too played out for me. Infinity War is a solid entry into the Marvel universe. They did a great job at including all of the characters and getting them on the screen. One of the key aspects that I liked about this movie was that they explained who Thanos is and what his motivations are."
"the movie was damn near perfect with the right amount of different marvel characters without making the movie feel like it just tried cramping all the characters in it. can't wait to watch part 2 next year."
"Disappointing commercial hype fest. Characters where way to soppy and the "no lives for lives" philosophy is fucking stupid. Thanks was great ending felt genuine and harsh music wasn't bad and it spawned a lot of good memes. Overall not worth watching in my opinion."
"best movie ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"The fight scenes were amazing. The film does the unexpected a lot so plan on anything happening. The movie is over 2 and a half hours but it didn't feel like it with the fast pace. The film does a great job of wrapping up 10 years but leaves a HUGE cliffhanger"
"For a movie that has to accommodate an estimated 76 characters it was pretty good. As a consequence of having so many characters there really weren't any character arcs and there wasn't much development for anyone but Thanos. It felt like a mashup of action sequences some that didn't fit together smoothly but I think that the directors did the best they could with this huge project. They also paired up characters who would have good chemistry with one another or who would create amusing conflict which I thought was clever. As usual the action sequences were excellent and well choreographed. There were some romances which were previously undeveloped and felt very last-minute. If you're a Bruce Banner fan you'll be happy with the generous screen time he's given here; same for Scarlet Witch fans. I think that the villain was also a success; Thanos seemed more reasonable than most antagonists and was very well set up. I was very happy with that end credits sequence and I wish I could spoil it for you but that's not what I do. If you're a Marvel fan I'd definitely recommend Infinity War. Just know that lots of people "die" in this movie so don't say I didn't warn you (I'm sure they'll be back it is a comic book movie)."
"Best movie I have ever seen after the dark Knight..."
"Absolutely fantastic! The visuals and the CGI in this movie are stunning and beautiful. There are many heart-warming and devastating scenes. This movie will go down in history."
"A movie designed for marvel fans; with every beloved character villain backstory and location in the MCU. Everything alltied up together in a bow is almost rushed and most definitely confusing for non-marvel fanatics. Leaves you thirsting for part two."
"Avengers: Infinity War is massively entertaining and spectacular. What an experience! Enough said."
"I'm impressed with how well they pulled off the new back story for Thanos. I still like the whole in love with Death thing better and it's a bit confusing that Thanos goes from caring about a little girl fighting for her life to sending her to fight to the death at some point later on. Knowing the release schedule of future films really undercuts the weight of the ending too; it's already clear who's going to be back by the end of Avengers 4. But this is the first movie ever to completely capture the feel of an event comic. The Guardians running into Thor Wong meeting Stark Spidey on a spaceship these are the kinds of things that you can usually only see in comics. What an amazing universe Marvel has created despite all the superhero fatigue it never ceases to amaze me. I just want to go back in time to 2006 to show little Adam writing a biography about Stan Lee everything that these movies would be able to pull off."
"Definitely well worth the wait. The only issues I have are with hulk/bruce banner and some comedy where it didn't fit in tonally."
"In a word "epic". I was not one minute bored or it felt too long or anything. Just great. And I actually wonder how the critics ( yes only 16% ) managed to "meh" this movie when they lifted "The last Johnson" to high heaven.....especially at RT."
"A great arc slowly build over the years. Fantastic plot great action amazing villan with a realy compelling back story (finaly matched just by Black Panters villan!). One of my favorite movie ever!"
"I just want to introduce to all my readers to my criticle of the movie Avengers Infinity War the directors was the brothers Russo Anthony and Joseph V. This movie have the genres of action and Syfy. The movie was setting in a lot of places like: Central ParkGeorgia  Atlanta United Kingdom Scotland Edinburgh New York Berwickshire and Train station Warenley.Avenger 3: Infinity War have 76 principals characters in them: The guardians of the Galaxy Avengers the olds and the news Black Panther etc. But the people were more fixed in Ironman Captain America Bruce Banner Thor Thanos Vision Black Widow.The movie is about the Guardians of the Galaxy Black Panther Avengers the new and the olds Wakanda saving the Universe of Thanos that want to destroy the half of the population in the Universe so our heroes are going to sarificated all to prevent that. I think that the movie is good because mark like a time in the line time of Marvel.It have a good cinematography i think that they made a god mix of colors in the suits and in the background of the movie and the cameras was good and I like the form they record they do it in good angle. Itdont have to much songs but in the enter of Ironman and Thor i like that songs. Special effects was amazing I they do it very good. Special effects that the movie transfer was saddest because of the deaths of a lot of characters.I give to the movie an 10 because it was all what I expected of Marvel because this movie it has been doing since 2016. I think that they would be happy because of the time that the Marvel Company takes to do this movie exactly how people want it. This movie teach that you never valorate something until you lost it.I just want to introduce to all my readers to my criticle of the movie Avengers Infinity War the directors was the brothers Russo Anthony and Joseph V.

"This movie was great and I loved it but there parts where it just took a while but then they just rushed the ending. After Black Panther I thought this movie was going to be disappointing but it wasn't Each character has an arc and my favourite character arc was Thanoses and well Thor's arc in this film was amazing but i would have to say that Thanos was a better and more drawn out character and I think Black Panther needed more of this"
"just passing in my opinion there was just too much they tried shoving into one movie for what seemed the sake of lining up with other marvel releases."
"The film was of a high quality all the scenes were fantastically animated they stunts were performed very well and I feel that the cast all gripped there roles very well .The film was intense at parts but still had humours jokes within.The cast of stars in the film all played there roles to the highest of there abilities.All of the action scenes with explosions and fighting all looked very realistic and was of a very high standard.The ending of the film was also very intriguing which will mean the audience will wanna see part 2."
"Apart from its daring ending Infinity War feels mostly like an average film in the series albeit a pretty bloated one. It'll be interesting to see where they go from here but as it stands a lot of it borders on headache-inducing saved by the charisma of its cast."
"It's an adrenaline pumping film with your heart dropping every s"AMAZING LOVE IT SO SAD PLAY DESPACITO 1004738 out of 10"
"One of the best if not the best marvel cinematic movie ever made. Can't wait for avengers 4"
"Awesome movie can't wait to see the next installment."
"Una pelï¿½cula gloriosa casi sin defectos quizï¿½ solo tomando un poco mas de seriedad en algunas escenas."
"personally I didn't think Infinity War was anything ground breaking however it is still a fun movie to watch around with a group of friends and if you read the comics and had watched every MCU movie and hated it good for you I enjoyed it."
"Finally got around to watching this with my teenage boys and have to say ... meh! If you had seen the other movies and were familiar with the whole "Infinity Stones" story line it was enjoyable and easy to follow. My problem was that I was TOO familiar with the Marvel characters to ignore the SJW changes Disney made. *** WARNING SPOILERS *** Disney turned the Hulk from one of the most powerful beings in the Marvel Universe to a sniveling inconsequential little brat. Disney also changed the Hulk's alter ego Bruce Banner a world renowned genius into a stupid comic relief sidekick the intelligence of whom is mocked by the Black Panther's little 12 yr old sister. Spiderman is still "Spider Boy" ... Tony Stark's little "golly gee Mr. Stark" comedy relief side kick. A great plan to defeat Thanos before he arrives on Earth would have worked but for one meat-headed male character's blind machismo. "Captain America" now wears all black no shield and goes simply by "Captain" so as to remove any and all reference to "America" from the movie (other than being the villianous gov't of white males that broke up the Avengers in the first place). Of course the ordinary female characters like Black Widow and the Wikandan female guards w/o powers are now somehow plowing through alien creatures with super speed and strength as if they were tissue paper. btw ... we're supposed to believe that the "enhanced intelligence" of Captain America leads him to conclude that they'd fare better fighting off the alien horde with about 2k guys and gals carrying spears than the U.S. military ... o.k. ... and of course every powerful male character goes up in a puff of smoke to make way for Ms. Marvel to waltz in and save the day in the follow up movie. THIS is why Disney is ruining everything with their SJWing ..."
"Everything was leading to this. "Avengers: Infinity War" offers enough emotional weight and action to overcome its overwhelming cast and slow pace to deliver a film that will shock and entertain audiences for years to come. Nerds and Geeks rejoice this is the film you've been waiting for."
"its a LONG movie and frankly if you weren't following the Marvel Avengers series you'd get lost quickly as one character after anothe enters and gets killed off. Elizabeth Olsen & Dr Strange are the two standouts but the rest was just kind of meh. And can someone pls kill off the Gwenyth Paltrow character ? She's annoying."
"Over 10 years of build up just for this movie although it wasn't perfect it was far from terrible The cgi was best on Thanos and decent to pretty good for everything else. They did a phenomenal job juggling all the characters it had plenty of humor while keeping a decently dark tone. All the fight scenes were amazing it had so may emotional moments and a few controversial ones too which are key to a good movie. Bu the absolute best part has to be Thanos himself we really are able to see the jolly purple giant for what he truly is. His reasons his backstory his love for Gamora his pride and his empathy for others. Rarely do I ever feel bad for bad guys but i did for this one."
"The Best Marvel movie hands down!!!!!!!!!!"
"THE VILLAIN PLAN IS STUPID IF WE ACTUALLY USE LOGIC AND COMUN SENSE. THE JOKES ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE AND THEY ARE NOT FUNNY AT ALL."
"Doesn't have struture or an story quips and unfunny jokes that will not age well with time= definition of a marvel movie."
"one of the best superhero movies iï¿½ve ever seen the soudtrack is amazing the visual effects are outstanding looking foward for the next avengers movie"
"Spoilers if you haven't watched it.After a 10 year build up we got what we all wanted. I wasn't disappointed. I was slightly expecting more but I wasn't disappointed.This was more of a Thanos film than an Avengers film which was great because we get to see more of our villain whom we've never seen much of. His motivation was altered from the comics. We never got to see Death so instead his motivation is to eradicate half of the universe to be able to use more resources on his planet Titan.Thanos' motivation is similar to Ra's Al Ghul from the Batman universe and The Thinker from The Flash. That's the best kind of villain motivation because in their point of view they're the heroes. And some of us even root for these villains.What I expected was for the film to have a longer run time. It was 149 minutes and even that is quite short. Yes SHORT. It had to be 3 hours at least. Because there are so many characters that needed more screen time.People be saying "The Russos did a good job in balancing the screen time between characters". But really? Cause all we saw was Thanos Iron Man Dr Strange Thor and Gamora. Everyone else was in a supporting role or even just cameos. I would have wanted more of Black Panther White Wolf Shuri and Captain America. Heroes on the ground were barely on screen.If the run time was longer all of this would be fixed and it would be perfect. Everything else was great the humour wasn't forced the visuals were beautiful the cast chemistry was amazing. But the CGI of Banner's face in the Hulkbuster suit was way off. That shit makes Superman's removed CGI moustache look beautiful.I found it ridiculous that they gave Bucky a new identity which is White Wolf just to kill him off or shall I say fade away. He may be back he may not. I don't know. But I surely want to see him again.Please don't blame Star Lord. He did the same thing when Ego revealed he killed his mother. No one was complaining then.Favourite Quote: What master do I serve? Am I supposed to say Jesus?"
"A great return to a long running series of films downsides were the hulk."
"In my last drunk stand i have to rate this 4.5 justice has been done now i may rest in peace... till tomorrow."
"It didn't move mountains like some claim but it did prove to be an entertaining watch. Plenty of wow moments"
"It was epic as I thought but still it makes you wonder... If this is the one way Dr Strange saw that they could defeat Thanos with so many heroes dying.. If they then use the time stone to "correct" all wrongs.. will not these to movies be unmade in some way??"
"Infinty war suffers from waaay too many characters massive overuse of cgi which doesn't hold up as much as promised. The story is... okay at it's beat but way too predictable and contains quite a lot of plotholes that people just seem to ignore... The villain is also very overrated even though his doings at first seems understandeable they're not. If you were to eliminate half the population of the universe you have to think about the after math. So many people would be depressed and kill themself. And many leaders would die and this would lead to wars over resources. After all this film does really disapoint but since my hopes weren't that high for the film it still gets 2/5 stars."econd this film was the first in the marvel cinematic universe to have the villain win and the ending is just heart wrenching as you get gripped so your ready for the next avengers instalment"
"Este filme reï¿½ne todos os Herois do universo Cinematografia da Marvel e tecnicamente comemora os 10 anos desse respectivo universo Eu amei o Filme fiquei 6 anos ï¿½ espera dele e fiquei sempre a imaginar a luta entre Thanos e Vingadores desde 2012 quando o vilï¿½o fez a sua primeira apariï¿½ï¿½o nas Cenas Pï¿½s-Crï¿½ditos do Vingadores 1. O Filme ï¿½ cheio de aï¿½ï¿½o e emoï¿½ï¿½o e sem dar grandes spoilers do final do Filme ele ï¿½ inesperado e muito comovente. Realmente podemos dizer que este ï¿½ o melhor filme do seu gï¿½nero."
"Great! Every character (mostly) in the mcu in 1 movie is hard to pull off but I think infinity war does it perfectly. Everyone worked well but the main reason I liked this movie was thanos. Finally MARVEL has cracked the villain code and has given it's fans (at least from what I thought) the villain they disserved. 10/10!"
"It was heartbreaking to me because all of my favorites heroes died. And especially you Thor. *slow claps*. Anyways it was actually great. But Robert Downey Jr was too much of a comedian he has to stop"
"Truly it is the best MCU movie yet! You're gonna want to watch it over and over again once you start! Thanos is without a doubt the Biggest BA MCU villain yet!"
"Talk about a cliff hanger! When I was watching this film in the theaters my roommates and I were in disbelief when the end credits started to roll. We just stayed in our seats because we wanted more. Right amount of action drama and dialogue. I really liked it and I'm excited for the next Avengers movie to be released. ."
"For a movie so epic in scope and integration -- 10 years in the making -- Avengers: Infinity War feels strangely inconsequential. Perhaps when there's so much at stake for so many different characters it's hard to find much to meaningfully hone in on and relate to."
"Just a awesome movie got so into everything and seeing Thanos getting the soul stone was amazing"
"Very much enjoyed watching this movie. Fun to watch them put the band together - they played well."
"Terrible movie just a series of boring fight scenes in weird environments... Already after 5 minutes one realizes the big mistake in watching this movie. Two and a half hours completely wasted that leave you really angry....anything else would have been a better way to spend time and money. Just a commercial meaningless effort."
"Thrilling and funny Avengers:Infinity War is one of my favorite movies yet. It balances the star talent of all the characters perfectly. Definitely a must see if you haven't already."
"Usually not one to buy a movie but this movie is something you want to watch over and over again. It's action packed and leaves a mystery of wanting more of this."
"The best movie I've seen so far."
"Great movie amazing action scenes and story....However ending is not clear and leaves questions."
"Avengers: Infinity War is Marvel Studios biggest and most ambitious entry to date. That fully realizes its gargantuan possibilities. Using the intriguing villian Thanos the film becomes the best MCU entry to date and one of the best superhero movies of all time. This movie will blown your and shatter your heart and soul. The stakes are higher than ever thanks to Thanos' goals of wiping out half of all life in the universe to bring balance toward the universe scales. In order to do this Thanos and his "children" know as the Children of Thanos( Ebony Maw Proxima Midnight Corvus Glaive and Cull Obsidian) will need to gather all six infinity stones. In order for Infinity War to make sense you will need to have seen nearly all other 18 MCU films that all interlude. For 10 years Marvel has been building up for this film which makes it that much bigger.The script is surprisingly touching and smarter than ever. Going to all the different locations across the universe heroes battling Children of Thanos  the outrider army and eventually intertwining them all to create on final epic gargantuan battle. That allows the film to end on a shocking chilling note. There are simply too many actors and characters to talk about each and every one of them but the ones who truly stand out are Robert Downey Jr's Iron Man Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange and Josh Brolin's Thanos. They all have simply brilliant lines that leaving you up in the air with a glimpse of the future of the MCU. Lines like "There was no other way" or " The hardest choices require the strongest wills" and " My only curse is you" as well as Ebony Maw's opening dialouge as he stomps over asguardian corpses leave you begging for more and goosebumps down your spine. Brolin as Thanos delivers one of the greatest villians in cinema history who has unmatched accomplishments. In every line Brolin shows you Thanos' human and empathetic side as well as is ruthless and psychotic side. The wait for Thanos was truly worth it as he says " [destiny] it's here or should I say.... I am." Stunning.My of my final notes is one the dedication and attention to detail put into this film and that is shown in the CGI. These astounding accomplishments resemble 2001: A Space Odyssey(1968). Thanos and the infinity gauntlet worn on his left hand look nothing less than absolutely perfect. Real lifelike. Unfortunately Infinity War is wildly unlikely to get much love from the academy that's ok because frankly it's to good for them. It will be a long wait for Infinity War's follow up Avengers 4 but with the Russo Brother's at the helm again the wait should be worth it. But still it will be a long year."
"Good pacing great CGI and incredible action set pieces make Infinity War one of the best superhero movies of all time."
"I was excited for this movie because I like most of the other marvelMovies but this movie had one of the worst movie script s every made.Their was no story in this movie at all all that happens is action and at the end spoliers!Every one died besides thanos.What a bad movie with such a good set upform the other marvel cu movies."
"They did pretty good juggling so many characters and the plot but I keep wondering how do people find this entertaining."
"Vingadores: Guerra Infinita ï¿½ um filme divertido extremamente impactante e perfeitamente bem orquestrado pelos diretores Joe e Anthony Russo. ï¿½ impressionante como a difï¿½cil tarefa de reunir 30 herï¿½is e 10 anos de universo cinematogrï¿½fico em um filme foi bem planejada e bem executada. Cada personagem tem sua participaï¿½ï¿½o (alguns com mais tempo de tela que outros) envolvimento emocional e quando ï¿½ necessï¿½rio que existam momentos de ovaï¿½ï¿½o e tristeza com cada um deles tudo ï¿½ feito incrivelmente. Alguns herï¿½is (como Feiticeira Escarlate Thor e Gamora) tï¿½m maior importï¿½ncia que outros mas o grande brilho nï¿½o estï¿½ em nenhum deles e sim no vilï¿½o. Thanos tem sua motivaï¿½ï¿½o seu plano e sua relaï¿½ï¿½o com a filha ï¿½ um dos grandes focos do filme. O CGI nele ï¿½ perfeito e vocï¿½ consegue sentir as emoï¿½ï¿½es do personagem digital como se fosse um ator real em cena. O ï¿½nico defeito da obra ï¿½ focar pouco nos vilï¿½es secundï¿½rios que sï¿½o descartados facilmente mesmo que isso nï¿½o tire nenhum brilho do filme. Depois de assistir sï¿½ nos resta esperar pela conclusï¿½o em Vingadores 4 e estou contando os segundos para que chegue logo.Nota: 4.5 (EXCELENTE)"
"as a big fan I was very exited to watch this after w"Loved thanos best villain ever."
"Avengers: Infinity War is an epic. It has one goal to complete which is to make a Lord of the Rings type epic and it sure completed it. This is one of the best blockbusters ever made."
"Successfully ties in all the events that happened in the MCU leading up to this moment. The death of half of our favorite heroes (even though they probably will be reversed in the next movie) provides a much needed sense of sentiment and emotion which may have been the sole missing necessity in prior movies. Can't wait to see what Marvel do next!"
"Best movie yet. I saw it in 4d and it was amazing. Would most definitely recommend to everyone!"
"I've recently watched this movie. It a super hero film. Watching this movie made me feel joyful as well as sadness. The movie is very funny but is also very sad towards the end.Had great action scenes . I'd recommend any action superhero fan to watch this great movies."
"The movie did a wonderful job giving everyone screen time and creating an intimidating and relatable antagonist. The conflict and the structure of the story was very well done while there were 3 different stories going on they were all unique and balanced out very well creating a story arc in each of the three making a fun fest of all our favorite superheroes in the past 10 years."
"Great sequel to the Avengers saga! Great compilation of characters from Marvel Cinematic Universe. Catchy story. The end was really stunning!!!"
"so funny and intresting obiusly fresh!"
"I watched it twiced i loved it only thing i hate is that hulk was being a little punk lol"
"Magnificent insurmountable and wonderful is infinity war a story that has been prepared for 10 years with 18 films and the first part of the culmination of this great story it is simply the best of marvel and in its genre. A festival of emotions and feelings that all fans will thank Marvel for the epic movie he has made."
"Personally I wasn't a very big Marvel fan before the film. But I went to the cinema to watch it with my friend and after not understand what was going on at all I then took it upon myself to watch the entire MCU films. A few heartbreaks and some tears later I finally understood the MCU and had to wait for Infinity War to be released on iTunes so I could buy it and put myself through even more heartbreak as I knew about the unpleasant ending. After watching it again I was in awe. I cried at the end due to the end of Spiderman before he had even started. But the film is amazing and it has made me even more excited for Captain Marvel and Avengers 4. I think that it has been the best Marvel film by miles due to how everything links up within the previous films and I believe that's something Marvel does so well and they cannot be beaten. They're the best. Overall I'd give Avengers: Infinity War a rating of 9.5/10 (only because they killed Bucky Barnes and I'm not happy about that. Also Peter Quill deserved his happy ending with Gamora) but it is now my all time favourite film."
"that was awesome. there was my favorite character in marvel starlord. although because of him they missed out very important things.. i cheer him!"
"An epic moving tale that rewards the investment we have put into this cinematic universe."
"Big colors and big noises for 156 minutes."
"From Comics now enriched to a movie with highly rated actors playing. Well done Russo Brothers! I can't wait for Captain Marvel to arrive and the next Avengers movie."
"It was alright (3 stars) but i have to stand against the 5 stars so 1 star"
"It is a testament to what Marvel and Disney have carefully built over the last decade that a film like this could exist at all and actually mean something."
"Probably the worst Marvel movie since Thor Ragnarok. Only worth watching on Blu-Ray so you can rewind parts. Overly busy fight scenes and no character development."
"The most hyped film in the MCU had a lot of expectations from me and many others. While there are some flaws this is an emotional surprisingly funny and action packed entry that has rocked the MCU.PROS:-Thanos is the best MCU villain right along with Killmonger. Josh Brolin was the perfect casting choice.-Action scenes are well shot and are ones Marvel fans have been waiting for years.-Brilliant performances all across the board particularly Brolin Saldana Hemsworth and Holland.-There are actually consequences to mistakes being made something that the MCU needed more of.CONS:-A lot of the scenes seem more like fan service instead of trying to progress the story especially scenes introducing the characters-A whole bunch of heroes packed into this film and sometimes it was a little overwhelming. Some heroes are unfairly not shown enough to make room for the "important" heros.-The Black Order or the children of Thanos are kinda just a footnote in the film and that can be disappointing considering their role in the comics.- Some characters act/make decisions that seem unlike them and that can be attributed to the Russo Brothers working with characters developed by many different directors.This was a satisfying and emotional entry into the MCU that succeeded in filling the hype. Some of the major flaws are keeping me from saying that this is the best MCU film but it is definitely the most important film so far and I am excited to see where they go from here."
"Most depressing movie ever I'm sorry I've seen it and won't recommend it to anyone."aiting 6 years. After watching it I got to say it was pretty damn awesome."
"unnecessary high ratings given for attention""A AWSOME MOVIE after waiting for ten years this is what we get good movie thanks marvel studips for bringing us a desevering movie for those ten years and a very speical thanks to the Russo Brothers for bringing us the avengers trilogy"
"Great effects and all but in the end nothing more than a boring collage of all things MCU. I ï¿½'m getting tired of the marve formula by now."
"I was taken away. Infinity War is definitely something I think everyone should watch and enjoy. As always Marvel didn't disappoint."
"Best avengers movie yet"
"Quite simply. If you didn't like this film. You have no taste in movies or are one of those assholes that dislike popular things to be edgey online. I heavily recommend this film and cannot wait for part 2"
"I'm watching this movie with my friends"
"A very mediocre film.Without pathos or emotion.Totally chill."
"Just a Jaw dropping ending!!!"
"Avengers: Infinity War is a well-directed action-packed brilliantly written superhero movie that once again brings the MCU to a higher level."
"Absolutely INCREDIBLE movie the best Superhero movie of ALL TIME---You will NOT BELIEVE the ending"
"The film was pretty good considering the story line. It was good to see a collaboration Of this magnitude Hit the big screen.However There were too many "Common sense" Flaws that kept appearing throughout the movie. On many occasions audiences young and old were saying "well why didn't they do this or that"? It would have been so much better I think if the writers would have Continued the storyline of world domination As opposed to A Overzealous Savior. The Titan Thanos could have easily realized additional harvests of fertile food for the entire universe as opposed to making trillions disappear don't you think?"
"MARVEL CONSEGUIU IRMï¿½OS RUSSO CONSIGUIRAM E KEVIN FEIGE CONSEGUIU. Um filme de 2h38min que passa lizo como se fosse 1hora pois a materia e o climax desse filme melhoram a cada passagem de tempo CGI TODOS EXCELENTES Thanos mostrou que definitivamente ï¿½ o vilï¿½o maia poderoso que cada herï¿½i teme a enfrentar."
"This was hard to watch. Glad I only pissed away 2 bucks."
"how does this even get under the teen titans go movie XDIts just the best movie"
"If you are a fan of the comic book infinity war you will not like the film because not only completely deviates from the storyline but you'll end cheering for thanos taht actually makes much more sense than the so called heroes. If you did not know infinity war you may like it you just need to have a craving for CGI long useless battle sequences and paper thin plots overstrechted for more than 2 hours. This movie could have used deadpool to lightnen up the mood."
"Loving. I need Loki back."
"was really good loved all the action ."
"I would never have believed you could really make this movie. But they did and it worked a lot better than I would have believed. Despite the insane number of characters the movie can be followed and enjoyed by almost anyone."
"This the greatest movie I ever seen"
"Great job balancing action and plot considering how many characters were involved. I didn't think Thanos would be interesting but they gave him motivations beyond the simple " I want to rule the universe.... MWAHAHAHAAHA." My only real complaint is that the Hulk was terrible in this movie. Every line uttered by Mark Ruffalo was cringe-inducing unfunny crap. Overall Joe and Anthony Russo are the kings of the MCU."
"This is the best movie I've ever seen from the CGI to the costumes drama action. It has everything a good perfect movei should have"
"Second best Marvel movie after Guardians of the Galaxy"
"This was a fun action/comedy/drama collage of comic book lore. It was great for fans who understood the connection to other films; but may be harder to appreciate on it's own without having seen the other films associated with this genre. The primary villain has great character development throughout the movie; however his supporting cast isn't developed as well. Dialogue and plot seems solid only slightly rushed with narrow focus of scope. It's a great set up for it's second part and is worthy of 4/5 stars."
"the best comic book movie. every comic book fan's dream come true.this mcvie is just like watching a video version of a comicbook"
"Finally a story that takes an unexpected and distressing direction!"
"Disappointing. Bloated (the first half should have been trimmed) too many characters Chris and Scarlett were hardly in it and by the end I wanted it to be over."
"Avengers fan here and Marvel fan going back to Spiderman number 1! This had almost everything."
"Just watched this one... #TeamThanos ...Loved it."
"My one big complaint about the film is that Iron man is a bit of a marry sue in the movie having everything he needs when he needs it. When there are other problems with the film there not big enough to really matter the film is great and truly lived up its hype."
"Horrible movie. Worst ending ever! Don't waste your time. You will regret it if you do."
"Esta es una de las mejores pelï¿½culas del aï¿½o una de las mejores pelï¿½culas del aï¿½o"
"Let me start with a word about my fellow critics. If you are looking for emotional moments depth of character endless dialogue that makes you contemplate life and gets you to feel self important and somewhat civilized and intellectual then you don't get it. You shoulden' have even gone to the theater. If you don't like cgi and fantasy then don't go watch a marvel movie expecting something you would that Oscars. Sit back with your pocorn and your soda and forget about your life for two hours to go on an epic ride with the Avengers. This movie is for the fans for the lovers of superhero's. You might have your favorite but if you love Iron man then you love the hulk if you love the hulk then you love captain America and on and on. On their own they are good they are great. But watching them together ups the ante. But what really really makes this movie though is Thanos. So evil disturbed and powerful that you can't help but be in awe. From his gloomy entrance into every scene his enormous ship to his near unbeatable power he never wavers or seems to be loosing. Its that feeling of impending doom that feeling of not being able to win that permeates the movie. The fear and hopelessness in Iron man's eyes the hulk refusing to fight Loki and Gamora easily killed and dying without ever putting up a serious fight. Thanos is different foe. The ultimate foe. And unlike any other superhero movie There is no happy ending. Although the end does not bring the usual satisfying feeling of justice being served and everything turning out to be alright its exactly that realism that real life aspect of things not always turning out alright that makes the movie so great and sets up so perfectly for a next installment. For the fans this was an epic movie and with so many great moments one to watch over and over. So far probably the best avengers movie yet."
"Possibly the best movie the Marvel Cinematic Universe has to offer. I enjoyed every second of it."
"Incredible amalgamation of several MCU characters into a masterpiece of a franchise movie. Marvel has truly outdone themselves with this creation."
"Inconsistent power levels but I still enjoyed the Guardians some characters could've been utilized better but this film got Iron Man & Thor right. Thanos is a good villain."
"Infinity war is the culmination of all that we have waited for in the massive MCU the past 10 years. Because of this the movie assumes that we are already connected and up to date on all the characters which if you are up to date makes for an action-packed movie that also has some of the most dramatic and emotional scenes in all of Marvel if you aren't up to date it makes for a jumbled mess but in my opinion that's on you for not watching the other movies before this one. As a film this is more about Thanos than it is about the Avengers and its all the better for it. Thanos is possibly the best Marvel villain to date with a heart-breaking backstory that can make you sympathize with him and almost see his point and yet also with all the power the battle to avengers and present more than a formidable foe"
"Beautifully made- and an emotional rollercoaster"
"3 words... It is AMAZING!!!!!!!! Go see IT!!!! You REALLY REALLY should go see it!"
"Poor and/or over used CGI - Strong and interesting characterisation"
"aS predictable at one plus one equals two. Pure garbage. good thing I didn't pay money to see it but I did lose two hours of my life that I would like to get back."
"yes it is that good"
"2.5 hours feels very fast when watching this movie"
"I thought this movie was absolutely great. It never got boring or anything and when the movie dipped in action it picked right back up. Not to mention the jokes and things made it hilarious this movie was absolutely great. I've seen it 3 times and I'd see it again I love all the marvel movies and this is definitely one of the if not the best."
"Thoroughly enjoyed this latest installment of the Avengers. With all the Easter eggs/hidden references glad is out on DVD so can rewatch and enjoy again."
"The second installment of this movie should be called Infinity War while this installment should be called Infinity Stone Collector. I give credit that the writers were able to weave an extraordinarily large cast of characters together into a relatively cohesive film. It is entertaining and funny in the way that Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther brought to the screen with the interpersonal banter. I did feel that since the cast was so large there were competing subplots that were interfering with the telling of the story. One question: Why does everyone all of the sudden know what the Infinity Stones are and what their respective powers are when the build-up movies all but ignore delving into their backgrounds?Overall this was an entertaining movie that is well worth a watch."
"my dick is immeasurablY hard after wathcing this movie"
"Avengers: Infinity War is the best superheroes movie ever made. It has a lot of thrilling scenes great entrances with a great soundtrack a lot of hilarious scenes the villain is fearless and appalling and it has an unexpected final that will delight because of its unpredictability but will touch the hearts of the fans."
"Really engaging movie. Found myself laughing crying applauding cheering...the full gambit of emotions. Gutted by the ending.. Long wait till resolution of anxiety resulting from movie's end."
"Absolute trash too much storyline. This series has reached its peak and continues to decline. Too many Hollywood egos to evenly distribute camera time too."
"The story is that the all powerful white guy wants to fix overpopulation by killing half the world. Are you anti birth control? You don't believe in climate change? Good actors badly written with some stupid ideas."
"*MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD* THIS MOVIE IS THE MOST ANTI-CLIMACTIC ENDING OF ALL TIME!.. I am so upset I just want to sue marvel.... if you really like all the characters in this movie.....it will leave you angry.."
"wow it's crazy good and also just plain crazy."
"Movie was shit jk that's why I gave it 5 stars"
"Not worth watching!!!"
"The writers of both this movie and the comic clearly have no imagination. An ultimate being who can do anything with the snap of a finger is completely undefeatable end of story. The purpose of super heroes is to fight super villains and they should be somewhat evenly matched to make the fight interesting. Introducing an omnipotent god as a villain against the avengers is ridiculous; it's like having Mike Tyson in his prime having a fist fight with a 10 week premature baby. The movie should have been 5 seconds long - camera pans to Thanos who snaps his fingers then the screen goes black and the credits role."
"Great film can't wait to see what will come next."
"Terrible! Intellectually dishonest...as you'll see. Skip this one; other Marvel series movies are very good. Stick to those."
"10/10This is huge. So many characters in the scenes yet each of them still has their moment. Especially Thanos."
"I personally really enjoyed this movie though there are some obvious holes in some of the well basic logic I guess. besides that there's the background. Though most of the people that read the original Marvel comics will know about this Marvel changed up the background for the movie a little bit. In the comics(now it's been a while so I'm sorry and please correct me if I'm wrong) the entire reason Thanos wanted to do any of this was to impress Death herself(yes Death is a she). And she claimed the only way to do so would be to kill half of the universe. But in the movie Thanos claimed that killing only half of the universe would bring peace getting rid of hunger/starvation and lack of resources for the amount of... living beings due to lack of words as he explains to Gamora when he explains why he slaughtered half of her people long ago. though I personally would love to see the comic books way bringing Death and the reasons Thanos cannot yet have her(which brings Deadpool into the mix but he isn't a part of this so just see my review of Deadpool 2 coming here soon for that info) into it I do understand why they didn't do it that way. 1 it probably would've added about 30 minutes to the already 2 and a half hour long movie. And 2 they would have to pretty much completely change some of the backstories of other characters like Gamora obviously. But overall the movie was very entertaining and pushed my level of expectation through the roof. And I must admit I did cry near the end especially when Spiderman started "drifting" so to speak."
"First movie I've ever cried to inAt some point in your life you watch a movie that has great special effects and all your favorite super heroes as a kid but the way they make these stories now as an adult is really hard to swallow. As you see scene after scene of basic super powers not used to stop the bad guy just to take you down to the predictable ending..."
"it is a good movie for action lovers"
"greatest movie in 2018 I mean all the characters is amazing they all have a right screen time it is just awesome"
"The culmination of a 10-year journey is here and it doesn't disappoint.Directed by Joe & Anthony Russo and starring almost everyone previously introduced in the MCU the film follows the Mad Titan Thanos while he attempts to collect all the infinity stones and bring balance to the universe.I have been a fan of the MCU since the beginning. Still I was anxious when I walked into theater because I thought it was next to impossible to pull off such a film and boy was I wrong.This film is everything I wanted it to be and more. The story is told from a unique perspective it features great characters and the action is very well shot.Yes the CGI is less than stellar sometimes like so many Marvel movies before but this can be forgiven when the action is this well shot and the characters are this likeable.All the actors bring their A-game but for me Chris Pratt's Star Lord really stands out here as a character whose forced to make probably the hardest decisions in the film.Everyone go out and see this movie. It's well worth your time and money."
"Normally I fall asleep during Marvel movies. This was not the case with this epic of a film. If you can get past all the ridiculousness of the characters you get yourself a truly thrilling and engrossing story and a story that will leaving wanting to wait for the finale. I was a lot more pleased by this movie than I thought."
"omg it is so good i love it"
"This was the best superhero movies I've ever seen! I thought it was a whole lot better than Black Panther!This action acting and visuals were amazingly fun! Although the ending was really sad in my opinion but the movie is still the G.O.A.T. of all superhero movies just behind the dark knight."
"Avengers: Infinity War in my opinion is the best movie in the Avengers universe. I was never a huge Marvel fan I always enjoyed watching any Avengers film but I was COMPLETELY blown away after seeing Avengers: Infinity War. There's only a small list of movies that have taken my breath away after seeing them and Infinity War is definitely one of them. From the incredible cast and character list to the memorizing special effects Avengers: Infinity War does not shy away from moments that make you rethink everything you have known about the Marvel Universe. One of my favorite parts about Avengers: Infinity War is the score it really helped tie in the special effects in addition to the story-line which contained both dramatic and comical scenes. The one thing you need to know is that the ending will truly mess. you. up. Even if you are not a fan of the Avengers and you see this movie you will still feel shocked."
"Those big cg fights are getting boring and were bad executed"
"This film starts very badly this film is good the special effects are excellent the end is disappointing the film is too violent for children and is Marvel film that belongs to Disney the Rating should be PG-13 because of the scene of violence.As well as the end is disappointing."
"Beautiful but that ending tho"
"10 Anos de espera valeram a pena para ver um blockbuster como este.Mas os erros eas pequenas coisas comoo star lord fazer praticamente o plot do filmee o tempo de rodagem.Mesmo assim o filme ï¿½ altamente com um final que deixou toda a gente surprendida."
"I can't praise this movie enough. It is an incredible achievement. Bravo."
"This movie is the worst I have ever seen unbelievably bad!"
"Really entertaining first half but the second half was snoozeville: boring recycled action sequences (did this movie share costs when designing monsters with A Quiet Place?). And that ending! LOL"
"The Avengers are a movie event straight from the comics. A really good step from the MCU."
"Fantastic movie! Best Avengers movie! I can't wait for the 2nd half"
"The mocie is the biggest failure as it lets down everyone's desire for a good movie. Not only is it an attempt to hit the comics literature but it fails in every attemot to entertain. It is all over the place. What a piece of sh*t movie."
"utter garbage. jumping plot lines no ending and extremely poor writing. Not that i've seen every disney movie but fair to say this was the death of the cash grab comic book genre."
"So mad that I even rented this. So glad that I didn't see it in the theaters. Weak and lazy writing." my life"
"Tras 10 aï¿½os y 18 pelï¿½culas finalmente llegï¿½ el estreno de la tan esperada Avangers: Infinity War la pelï¿½cula mï¿½s grande y ambiciosa del universo cinematogrï¿½fico de Marvel.Finalmente Thanos decide calzarse el guantelete del infinito y buscar por su cuenta las seis Gemas del Infinito para lograr su objetivo: acabar con la mitad de la vida en todo el universo y asï¿½ llegar al perfecto equilibro del todo. Para impedir que Thanos se haga con las gemas todos los hï¿½roes deberï¿½n unirse para acabar con la amenaza mï¿½s grande a la que se han tenido que enfrentar.La pelï¿½cula no para un segundo. Hay mucha acciï¿½n hay mucho humor (del que ya nos acostumbrï¿½ Marvel) hay muchas referencias hay muchas revelaciones y sorpresas y hasta hay emociï¿½n algo no tan comï¿½n en este tipo de pelï¿½culas. Las dos horas y media de duraciï¿½n pasan volando y dan ganas de que dure dos horas.La conexiï¿½n entre tantos personajes (muchos de los cuales jamï¿½s se habï¿½an encontrado antes) era de lo mï¿½s esperado pero tambiï¿½n de lo mï¿½s temido en cuanto a cï¿½mo iba a suceder y sin duda se resolviï¿½ de la mejor manera. Todos tienen su momento para destacarse y mï¿½s allï¿½ de que por momento la trama transcurre en 3 o hasta 4 locaciones bien diferentes la narraciï¿½n logra que lo saltos especiales transcurran de una manera coral sin provocar grandes agujeros.Mucho se puede hablar de Thanos desde su construcciï¿½n psicolï¿½gica y emocional pero por el momento vamos a decir que es simplemente el mejor villano que hemos visto en pantalla. Siempre este fue un punto flojo en las pelï¿½culas de Marvel pero con Thanos redimieron todo y crearon al villano perfecto con una verdadera motivaciï¿½n y a quien incluso se puede considerar el verdadero protagonista de la pelï¿½cula.Infinity War seguro pase a la historia como una de las mejores pelï¿½culas de superhï¿½roes de la historia y sin entrar en ningï¿½n tipo de spoiler deja la puerta abierta para que Avengers 4 pueda ser aï¿½n mï¿½s grande.Es una pelï¿½cula hecha para fanï¿½ticos y los fanï¿½ticos la van a amar."
"Tiene una de las mjores escenas de acciï¿½n (la de New York) de la saga."
"Visually well done actors play their parts well but the overall plot is very tired and obvious. The way Thanos so easily gets some of the Infinity Stones makes little sense other than the fact that this a movie and he needs to get them quick."
"This movie deserves a way bigger scores than it has already. I've never seen a movie with this many characters in it and still hold integrity To each and every character! This movie was unbelievable mastery!"
"So many things wrong already listed by many reviewers here. so I'll focus on one of the things that made me laugh hard during the very serious ultimate fight to save half of the galaxy when Thanos instead of killing his deadly enemies he grasp keep punching them out one by one so they can wake-up and fight back 10 seconds later : this alone made my day !"
"This movie is amazing! Most of the rotten reviews are people that didn't understand the movie and thanos' motives. Although if you want to further understand the movie you have to watch most of the MCU movies."
"this movie managed a cast of 55 people and its not complete chaos how is this possible"
"By far the best experience I've ever had at the movies! I was blown away with the story and Thanos was an incredible villain. Josh brolin really made this movie all about him. A masterpiece of a film! 5/5"
"Avengers Infinity War might have too many prerequisite movies for the viewers to understand and comprehend all the Avengers that show up but overall it's colorful and filled with memorable CGI animation and fights due to a mega-budget of about $400 million. I also don't get the "Squidward" insult at Ebony first off he has NO NOSE and second he looks a lot more like Voldemort."
""Infinity War Was Worth the Wait"Marvel has reached the epic climax of their 10 year long Marvel Cinematic Universe with the arrival of Thanos. This is an action packed thriller with a massive cast of all Marvel's beloved heroes. The most screen time is allotted to Iron Man Doctor Strange Black Panther Thor Vision and Scarlet Witch. It is a large endeavor that turns out to be highly enjoyable.The Russo Brothers direct Infinity War with surprising care to character development and intimate moments. We get entertaining interactions between the leads and supporting characters that are sure to please. The stakes are raised to intense heights with major deaths and actual consequences. The combat is is cool precisely choreographed. Commendations are in order for The Russo Bros. for adapting the most iconic moment in comic book history with The Snap. Thanos is intimidating and works well as a villain. Infinity War is a well made movie.The acting performances are particularly endearing from Robert Downey Jr. Benedict Cumberbatch Chadwick Boseman Chris Hemsworth Paul Bettany and Elizabeth Olsen. I really like Chris Evans as Captain America and Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow but they are not given a lot to do relative to the aforementioned stars. The main star is of course Josh Brolin as Thanos. Brolin's massive stature and dramatic delivery bring the mad titan to life with terrifying realness. He adds an emotional depth to a character that could have easily been overdone. Thanos is monstrous. The cast is well executed for such an enormous ensemble. You get moments with every character but there are certainly standouts. Alan Silvestri's score is beautiful and memorable. The inspiring theme for The Avengers and the horrifying accompaniment to Thanos is epic. Silvestri delivers his greatest composing yet. You will leave the theaters but Infinity War's score will remain with you.Overall Infinity War is entertaining and a well made movie not just by Marvel's standards. The acting is a few notches above the standard fare for Marvel's films. I think most audiences will enjoy all Infinity War has to offer."
"This movie blew me away with its amazing CGI  good acting  and its ability to handle so many characters at once. The ending made me cry"
"Infinity war has been 10 years in the making. Each MCU movie starting all the way with iron man has been leading to this right when nick fury broke into tony starks house talking about the avengers was the first step and it was all leading here to the end. The story juggles almost every character introduced in the mcu in this movie(those who were not will for sure show up next year) as they find out about the master plan of the mad titian thanos as he looks to wipe out half of the universe. The star of this movie is thanos who is maybe the best cbm villain beating out heath ledgers joker as his motives are somewhat heroic but insane he is as frighting as he is interesting and sympathetic 10 years for him was well worth the wait. The rest of the characters play off each other well and add complex to the story as we do feel like the weight of everything is on the line in this film. The humor of the mcu is also not lost. First timers to the mcu will come to love these characters as well and like everyone the haunting ending will bring a tear to anyones eye. Infinity war lives up to the hype and beyond the end of everything has never been this good."
"I hate it when studios but the storry of one movie in two."
"This is just fantastic. I've watched about ten times and it is still so good for the eye."
"Amazing how they connected all the MCU movies without making it feel to cramed."
"When compared to other Marvel films this is one of the best. Time is well spent between each of the characters and the plot flows nicely."
"This is what all of Marvel has led up to. Everybody (except Korg Valkryie Ant-Man & Hawkeye) is here! It was just a little bit disappointing. I've been waiting over three years for this but it just feels like any other Marvel Studios film. Some action here and there they throw some jokes into the mix and they've got some surprises. What I enjoyed the most is the very start and the very end. Everything in the middle is just the regular. But it is still an enjoyable one."
"This is the best cross over of super heroes in movie history. I would estimate that each character got about 8 - 10 minutes of screen time expect IronMan and Thanos. Iron Man probably got about 15 and Thanos. What is also great is someone could even only watch the four Avengers films and have a great time and understanding of the story over these past 10 years of movies. A movie packed with easter eggs that only fans would understand just like all the others."
"While I was excited to watch this movie IW turned out to be a great letdown ranging from poorly written script sloppy and unfunny jokes terrible overused CGI OOC behaviors while completely missing creativity and driving dynamic as well as real drama. Even though I like almost every character their death fell flat and unaffecting expect two or three. Personally I checked four times how much have remained of the runtime as I was bored out of my mind and was very dissappointed after such a great predecessor as Taika Waititi's Thor: Ragnarok."
"cant wait next one :)"
"I am totally shocked that this movie does not have at least a 98% rating-totally action packed all the actors had stellar performances the plot was so well thought out special effects were flawless and amazing and the ending left my jaw dropped and just wanting Part 2 to immediately be available."
"A movie worth watching more than once. Everything was intense. I would give it 5 stars if the ending wasn't so tragic."
"Me it was all right but I hate how I'm always left wondering why only some died and the rest didn't that's no fun and makes me mad"
"A potent and over cluttered cinematic blockbuster that somehow avoids feeling overwhelming despite its scope and cast of characters. Instead it is a surprisingly bold somber addition to the MCU that will whet appetites for the final installment while appealing to fanboys and general audience alike. Rating: 84"
"It suffers from too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in Game of Thrones. Duration increases and yet each character gets less screen time. Strange and Stark exchange some funny lines but that's about it. Thanos did nothing wrong it was the writers."
"This movie represents the best story-telling and acting of any Marvel movie yet created. There are always going to be plot holes in made up stories but Infinity War has everything needed in a blockbuster movie."
"This freaking movie sucks"
"MSU actually brought everyone together to save the universe one more. maybe last. time.Same old thing as ever just bigger larger and frankly a bit more confusing.But that is just fine for me. Its the first time that i see the villain be as stong as he is said to be. And the first time that a villain does the things he does because of something that actually IS pretty understandable. If you love avengers good CGI good acting "saving the world" theme and big battles then this is the movie you are looking for. If you want something more than that then you are going to be disapointed."
"By far one of the best movies of 2018! What more could you want more from a movie it's Marvel it's action it's a unique & ingeniously beautiful adaptation. Everyone has something different to bring to the film and I found myself connecting with each character as an individual on a near personal level. Although this is only part 1 I give props to Thanos for actually having a bad guy win a movie for once!"
"Everything you'd want in this mega blockbuster superhero film."
"Fantastic movie with some of the best CGI I've ever seen. Everything weaves together quite nicely and most characters get ample screen-time to seem atleast a bit relevant. This obviously sets us up for many more sequels. A+"
"A blockbuster in every way."
"too many hero deaths dr strange not using the time stoneonly a little bit better than thor the dark world"
"Very goodBut.Disappointing ending"
"You can love it. You can think it was a worth while movie. But this movie makes me feel like dairy cow being completely sucked dry. I was prepared for this movie to be one big show stopping hit. A big amazing movie for the summer. For the century. But no. It was an alright movie that was a prequel for a hundred more $15 a pop movies. It is complete bait. Watch it so you will end up paying more and more and more until you finally reach a conclusion. Let's tell everyone this is a big ball busting movie with all their favorite characters! Then kill them all off until they pay more money to see the sequel. I give it 1 star not because it was a terrible movie but because Hollywood gets away with this crap too much. Ticket prices need to come down or movies need to finish a $15 dollar worthy two hour story in two hours."
"Too much buzz. Not so great as the propaganda!"
"Great movie just wish I was part of it"
"Best avengers movie ever"
"Ya se pasï¿½ de rosca mucha ficciï¿½n y poca realidad"
"It had a promise of being epic and there's a few very minimal moments (which are kept short) where glimmers into the psyche of the characters are show but a parade of fighting scenes alone does not make a great movie."
"I was legit nervous walking into this movie fearing that Marvel would somehow find a way to not deliver on the hype. I'm very happy to say that my fears were put to rest as I sat through this near masterpiece of a superhero film. Holy hell did they truly deliver. Ten years in the making and the patience of both sides paid off. Never have I walked out of a comic book feeling so relieved and excited for the sequel. People might laugh at this but I felt like I walked out of The Empire Strikes Back of this generation. I witnessed movie history. I will be counting down the days until I get to see how the Avengers go up against Marvel's truly biggest bad."
"Oh yes Marvel does it again this one is as good as the rest....if you liked them this is a must see."
"BEST MARVEL MOVIE EVERRR!!!!!"
"Infinity War uses so many superheroes in one movie most would suspect a shameless cash grab. They would be very very wrong With great visuals amazing action and an incredible villain this is one of Marvel's best and that was already a high bar."
"strong storyline very good effects and great cast. I didn't watch most of the Marvel universe movies but it's easy to follow regardless"
"The best film! Marvel can make films - I advise everyone You will not regret. Watching this using boxxy software The film is teeming with superheroes"
"Maybe this is more than a movie is an experience are so many emotions in this film especially when you follow this cinematic universe since the first Iron Man..."
"With all of it's undeserved hate I am emotionally broken as whenever I left the theater I could hear a peep out of the audience watching with me.10/10 B's (if you hate seeing onscreen death of beloved Marvel Characters do not hurt yourself by seeing this movie)"
"This is a great movie. But I've seen the MCU do way better. Black Panther. Thor: Ragnorok. Infinity War just doesn't capture the same feel as those movies."
"Excellent movie. Great pacing and balance between all these characters. The story doesn't get lost like it did in age of ultranationalist.Beat marvel film as of yet."
"One of the better Marvel movies. Plenty of action and humor makes this really enjoyable. Definitely worth seeing."
"The culmination of 10 years in the Marvel Universe pays off and exceeds expectations."
"Holy Crap! This is my new Favorite MCU Movie The fact that the Russos can do so many characters is awesome. I'm so glad Thanos was actually a good Villian and I'm so happy with this movie."
"LIVES UP TO THE HYPE"
"Avengers Infinity War en un principio prometiï¿½ que iba a ser una gran pelï¿½cula y sin duda alguna lo fue una espera que al fin tï¿½rmino y que valiï¿½ la pena cada segundo"
"LOL I thought Justice League was bad."
"the best I've ever seen."
"I personally thought that this was one of the best MCU films to date. Thanos is probably the best villain the MCU has ever seen. Some characters are left behind in the film (Cap Black Panther Rocket etc.) But given the number of characters it successfully juggles it is a big achievement. Massive credit has to go to the writers (Marcus and McFreely) as well as the Russos."
"Avengers:Infinity War is a mess. First off the film has numerous plot holes and moments of pure stupidity. Secondly the film's pacing is awful having the beginning be just conversation with a few action scenes scattered in between and the second half is pure and most of the time boring action."
"Its a Marvel overload. I wished they had added more detail to the little story arcs and made the whole thing longer."
"The plot was excellent but there were too many characters and some just don't have the right chemistry."
"I LOVED this movie. It would be 5 stars if I didn't notice the C.G.I. a lot. Other than that amazing movie. Good plot good characters and it gets you in the feels."
"Le rï¿½unissement de succï¿½s donnant naissance ï¿½ l'un des meilleurs succï¿½s jamais vue. Un dï¿½but dramatique et captivant et une fin horriblement ï¿½mouvante. J'ai adorï¿½ et j'ai hï¿½te au prochain succï¿½s de MARVEL! ï¿½a vat ï¿½tre malade!"
"Alot of these "critics" need fired asap Typical brainless bittter crybaby idiots they should stick to pointless boring nonesense bed time stories like Titanic. Nothing but a bunch of wanabe buzzkills."
"Puedo decir con tranquilidad que Infinity War es posiblemente la mejor de las pelï¿½culas de Avengers que hemos tenido hasta el momento y de las mejorcitas dentro del MCU. Puede tener algunos problemillas de guiï¿½n y aunque Thanos sea un gran villano tambiï¿½n se le puden ver las costuras en algunos momentos. Pero si has ido siguiendo con religiosidad todas las anteriores entregas de esta mega franquicia A:IW es sin duda el "mash-up" perfecto dedicando el tiempo necesario para cada personaje (dentro de las posibilidades lï¿½gicas) e incluso ayudando a desarrollar algo mï¿½s algunos de ellos (como Iron Man Thor Gamora o Grut).La acciï¿½n estï¿½ rodada de forma perfecta y aunque ya no tenemos esos action set pieces tan realistas de los Russo (Winter Soldier se me viene a la mente) tambiï¿½n es cierto que las nuevas batallas requieren mï¿½s este tipo de acciï¿½n mï¿½s hiperbï¿½lica. Si os gustï¿½ la escena del aeropuerto en Civil War preparaos con esta cinta porque no vais a parar.Es interesante tambiï¿½n que se dedique tiempo a desarrollar la relaciï¿½n entre Thanos y Gamora a travï¿½s de la cual aprendemos mï¿½s sobre el pasado y las motivaciones de Thanos.Sin duda una "must see" para los amantes de Marvel."
"Not a big fan of the ending but AWESOME FILM"
"Frustrating to watch. I felt like there were seven too many out-of-character moments plot holes flaws in logic and generally annoying themes. The villian Thanos seemed to want to be but failed to be a sympathetic villian and just succeeded in bothering me as he used nothing but brute force to power through obstacles. Characters not doing all that they could- why did nobody try and cut his arm of? Why didn't certain characters fight back and instead just stood there passively as he killed them?- just made the writers seem lazy. Overall I didn't enjoy this and wish the writing had more thought put into it to make this the truly stellar meeting of worlds this movie could have been."
"The culmination of 10 years has paid off this was exciting funny revealing and all around awesome. This is what we've been waiting to unfold since the first Avengers and now with Infinity War we can see that the Marvel Cinematic Universe will never be the same again."
"Ummmm. Its shocking funny and extremely sad. Watched 3 times in row. But if you want to understand you need to watch the other movies (the previous avenger films Thor films Guardians of the galaxy (both) Spiderman movie...)"
"If you love Marvel you will love this movie. But if you love enticing emotional well directed well written incredibly edited movies with amazing visuals slight pacing issues and amazing scores than you will REALLY love this movie"
"Infinity War wastes no time bringing you right into the action. Unsurprisingly Infinity War is for the fans only. This film is fast complexly woven to incorporate all the characters their relationships and dynamics over an overarching tale of a MEGA super-power coming to destroy the world (surprise). The biggest achievement is that they took the time to build the antagonist which has been a low point for most of the MCU films. With perspective Infinity War means much more and provides enough thought to match the visual spectacle of battle. Yup so pretty dang good. It's a must see for any Marvel fan."
"Epic fun! Can't wait to see what happens in the next Avengers film next summer!"
"A waste of 2 hours and I otherwise love the Avengers and Captain America movies"
"Best sci-fi/action movie I've ever seen. ever!"
"Im scared I dont know what was that. It was my mother freaking HUSBAND CAPTAIN AMERICA!!!!!! AND he HAS a BeArD!!!!!"
"One of the best movies I've ever seen. Stellar on all levels."
"Great Movie definitely will watch the sequel!"
"Fireworks show for a couple hours. Even the smoke make noises. CGI filled emptiness."
"muy bien realizada las escenas donde deben estar un muy buen libreto los personajes son perfectoslas peleas son muy originalesutilizan bien sus poderes hay trabajo en equipo y buenos mensajes que dan a pensarhan trazado una linea que muestra la madurez e la empresa y nos muestra el gran trabajo que se ha echo ademas que han generado mucha polï¿½mica y teorï¿½as."
"Everything has been building up to this epic spectacle of a superhero movie!!! It took 10 consecutive years and 18 movies to this moment with the biggest and baddest villain that the MCU has ever had that being Thanos. The movie does an excellent job of balancing all the characters the action sequences the humor and the drama throughout in a well-paced story that brings the MCU to what was planned since the very beginning in 2008 with Iron Man. Avengers Infinity War is an awesome experience of seeing a comic-book come alive and being a spectacular movie. Probably the best comic-book movie since The Avengers and The Dark Knight."
"Great story amazing action sequences not memorable soundtrack."
"With dozens upon dozens of characters to fit in and give storiesthis film completely delivers. Josh brolin portrays the mad titan in a scary yet relatable way. The action is phenomenal and there are many charismatic performances."
"It was 'ok' I guess."
"This movie was slow paced and tied together with improbable coincidences like getting the soul stone Thanos needed to sacrifice the one thing he loves let it be that that thing was standing besides him how convenient! Other than Black Panther and warriors from Wakanda but it shows more the often that The Avengers and the Marvel Universe lack diversity and is white privileged. It is yet again white people saving the Universe! Where did we hear that before! Also why does Marvel incorporated Thor a greek god in their series and not for example the God Krishna from India? Towards the end there were so much of the same going on that you don't feel any empathy anymore of the entire Avengers crews when they died one by one and you start to think the Universe might aswell be perished who cares....cant stand the fact that this movies continue to go on and on and wishing for it to end! The ending however is a cheap shot for a second installment....."
"The comedy was on the mark but the scenes that were designed to make the audience feel for the characters rarely worked"
"I want my money back- worst movie ever after this one I won't bother to ever pay to watch another one. You really screwed it with this one Marvel."
"The best film that i have ever seen. Action everywhere many heroes. Dam wainting for part 2."
"Leading up to this I had been terrified I really didn't want this movie to fail and hoped to god that it would deliver and honestly this movie was fantastic. The biggest issue most marvel movies have had so far is the boring lifeless underused disposable villians they've had. But for a surprising change the real main focus of this movie is the villian and this really does feel like mostly thanos's film. Since the movie gives us so much time with the villain it really lets us connect with him and understand why hes doing what hes doing. Thanos truly is the best villain the MCU has ever seen in my opinion. Something i loved especially about the character was just how brutal he truly was since another issue the previous villains had was that some of them really didn't feel like big threats at times but Thanos changes all of that from the very beginning the opening scene he really shows the audience just how badass and brutal he really is and for the first time in an mcu movie i think we can all say that the villian was the greatest part of the movie.Despite Thanos really being the main highlight of the movie thats not to say that the rest of the movie wasn't amazing also. The heroes as well in this movie were fantastic some standout performances would have to be RDJ  Tom holland  Benedict Cumberbatch and Chris Hemsworth  many more also . In my opinion i would have to say the standout hero of this film is Thor one of the main reasons why the character worked so well for me is because he is given an arc at the beginning and his arc actually does finish by the end and the wakanda entrance by him is the most standout scene and my favourite scene of the entire film. All and all both the villian and heroes are brilliant.The issues i have with the film simply just revolve around the hulk and how he was utilized. It's not that i have an issue with the hulk not coming out in the movie despite the beginning as i know that it connects to what will happen in Avengers 4 so im not to bothered about that. The execution of it is what annoys me as although at times in the film it feels as though the scene should feel dramatic when the hulk wont come out it is always played for laughs and never feels serious but despite that small issue i have i think this movie is a true master piece. No i do not think this is the best marvel movie but it is my favourite at the moment. Overall fantastic experience watching this."
"Marvel delivers your definitive movie with breathtaking action sequences and a respectful villain."
"#MovieReview 35 ?? Thanos resolve cuidar dos mundos ï¿½ sua maneira enquanto busca as jï¿½ias da coroa. Muitos personagens mundos lutas CGI... Muito bom mas achei meio confuso. Nï¿½o entra como meu favorito dos super-herï¿½is. Ou esteja tendo overdose de filmes Marvel."
"To be Continued......"
"The best super hero movie of all time."
"I think the movie could have been better with an higher rating or even R-rating because the brutality of Thanos did not convey on the big screen.For exemple the scene in Logan movie when they try rob Wolverines limousine and he puts a blade though one guys head it shows Wolvie is someone you shouldnt mess with and it was jaw dropping and made a huge impact to the rest of the movie in the sense of showing what kind of character we are following.That same brutality should have been used in Loki/Thor scene and also by Thanos entourage.It was not dark enough...hope part 2 has a better script. Then it was way to many characters used in the movie but overall a good movie."
"the end was total bullvery globalist of them to kill off half of the universewhat a way to kill a great seriesspiderman no moreguardians no moredoc strange nope he's gone tohulk yeah he was worthless just like the activist that plays Bruce"
