"Everything was awesome :)"
"the first half of this movie is just decent but the second half of this movie was awesome! the end credit song made me laugh harder than i did at the rest of the movie.the only thing making me not give it a 4/5 instead of a 3.5 is the first half drags a little too much for me."
"I took my nephew and I felt like a kid again seeing the good guys win the day. I would of had loved to see a lego movie made up of my favorite 90s characters. Imagine Lego Liono and Raphael? Five stars for a kid movie."
"This is a good movie. I wonder when it�(TM)s going to be on DVD"
"Not as good as the first one but enjoyable enough to be a good family film to put on the list for movies to see."
"The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part good movie entertaining leaves me without words certain parts of the movie the songs and all its funny characters. I hope and do the third part."
"Lego Movie 2 not quite as good as the first one but still has lots of heart and fun"
"The toxic masculinity plot line is ridiculously untrue and is sets a bad example for how society should treat young boys."
"What a dissapointing wreck I LOVED the first one and the start of this one was good but I feel I would have been more disapointed if it wasn't the lego movie characters if it wasnt it would have be a complete fail. It was bad."
"This movie is great! Since the first movie was a success the film directors figured what everyone loved about it and made a super brick built hilarious sequel! But sadly there were some scenes where this movie go a bit too silly yes of course it has to have a sense of silliness but there were a lot of cheesy silly jokes that were just a bit chilldish. I thought they learned their mistake from The Lego Ninjago Movie but maybe we� 1/2(TM)re going to keep seeing this in the future Lego movies. Let� 1/2(TM)s hope it gets a bit less silly. Anyway despite the negatives this movie showed us a great idea of a story so I would recommend it. And the songs are also really catchy the is this catchy song in it that will get stuck inside your head!"
"This film was a delightI didn't like it as much as the first. However still really funny with a great twist."
"fun and family friendly a great and funny movie the whole family can enjoy"
"Good movie. If you are a fan watch it at the movie if not pick up the disk."
"Really fun for the whole family - probably second best in the franchise."
"This was a pretty good movie took both my kids (11 + 8) and they enjoyed it."
"The Lego Movie was a really fun sequel not as much fun as the first one but it was still a joy to look at. The story takes off right where the first one ended and it continues the story in a nice and understandable way although the story itself isn't actually all that good...But why does it seem so good?Because the whole movie is filled with cameos and references. A few examples are the Bruce Willis cameos and the references of all the Batman actors and in general the references of the Marvel and DC movies which just make The Lego Movie a fun experience for everybody that understands the references. For everyone else it's just a movie that is sometimes funny but most of the time the story isn't well constructed it's a pretty basic story-telling but: There are a few twist and turns that make the movie more interesting at some points."
"Awesome flim that talks about siblings and maturity"
"I like the songs! Everything is awesomeee"
"Huge disappointment. What was once a rising franchise with clever writing and interesting meta commentary tried to be twice as meta with an overly complicated plot that ran too long and a familiar take on its villains. Even the kids in the theatre were starting to yawn past the 90min mark."
"It wasn't as good as the hype. I fell a sleep for most of the movie and what i did see wasn't good."
"I was tired when I saw it and could not stay awake. Not what I hoped and no where near as good as the first. Proof that retread sequels are not worth it."
"Being a fan of the first Lego Movie I was quite excited for part 2. I was a little disappointed however for a few reasons. I think that the cast is great as it was in the first movie and I think that the animation style and music are all fantastic and really provide an interesting visual experience. But there's quite a lack of a plotline that is easy to follow. The plot takes turns here and there and I found myself genuinely confused at parts of the movie because I couldn't tell what was really happening. You have a general understanding of the plot at the start but as it develops at least for me it was difficult to follow. Another thing that I was disappointed about was that Will Ferrell was not very present in the movie. This is not a very big issue but I absolutely loved his performance in the original and I was upset that he was never shown in the film and only had a few lines of dialogue. I think that this is a great movie especially for young children. It is filled with lots of humor dancing and especially Legos. But if you ask me you're better off with the original."
"This gets old; the first one was better."
"Its funentertaining and very pleasing to watch."
"This was a great movie! Fun for everyone all-around with pop-culture references for the adults and funny quips for the kids"
"No of course it's not as good as the first. It doesn't flow quite as naturally and it as somewhat expected lacks the shock and surprise most felt while watching #1. But man does it still deliver as a fantastic movie.The animation is as always gorgeous. And the characters are still super fun to watch. The movie may ever so slightly overdo it with self-referential humor but it's hard to complain when you're laughing your head off.This story contains a beautiful message that all kids and adults should hear and averts expectations with a wonderful plot twist. It follows in its predecessor's footsteps in throwing out the rule book and traveling wherever the filmmakers' imaginations take it. The movie creates beautiful unique and fun-to-watch worlds that you simply can't visit in any other movie universe. The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part (which is absolutely brilliant name) is storytelling at its best and should be witnessed by as many people as possible."
"I thought the movie was super I loved the songs especially "Everything is not awesome" and I loved when Emit was showing Lucy around his house."
"really good movie not better than the first one but i loved it its perfect just like the first one"
"Movie was fun to watch. good story....except the ending."
"This movie is sooooooooo good. it� 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s not as good as the first LEGO Movie but is nearly as great. I recommend this movie for ages 0 - 99"
"I was slightly disappointed not as fun as the first movie and my 12 year old niece actually got bored."
"Not as good as the first. Not by any means a bad film. If you liked the first one this is more of that with music"
"Everything is okay? So picking up where the last movie left off these Lego people just want to live their lives. Of course that wouldn't make for an interesting story so there is an alien threat that has unknown intentions and they have to figure out exactly how they are going to handle it. Now the temperature on the Lego movies has been one that has subject to change with the quickness. I loved the original and I thought that their take on Batman was pretty hilarious... but I felt that Ninjago was not even worth the time of day. Because we have been getting so many Lego movies in rapid succession I can't help but say that they have been oversaturating; this new movie has been underperforming at the box office and I think that is entirely because public interest has been waning. I am fairly sad to report that I feel like The Lego Movie 2 is everything that I feared the first movie would be. Now I know that I was hungry and a bit vexed by some really pointless traffic driving to the theater but if this movie had really brought it those items would have been afterthoughts. I just didn't find this to be very funny when everything is broken down. I wasn't bored and checking my watch or anything so it does have a leg up on Ninjago but at the same time I was just waiting for this to be over after I realized halfway through that it wasn't going to get any better. The jokes never really hit and they are more random than anything which is very surprising because Phil Lord and Chris Miller penned the script (but didn't direct). About half of the main characters from the first movie that I felt warmly about don't have anything to do here; they are completely pushed to the background and if I could sum up this movie in a phrase it would be lost goodwill. I think the animation in this is still quality and I don't have any complaints there. I did not care for any of the music in this and I found it more annoying than catchy especially when they were trying to present the next "Everything Is Awesome" imitation. I did think the character of Rex Dangervest (also voiced by Chris Pratt doing a Kurt Russell impression) did bring something to the table and I will at the very least say that anything with the raptors in this did make me laugh. Other than that I got light chuckles at best out of this and The Lego Movie 2 is a disappointment for me."
"The Lego Movie 2 is not only as fun and clever as the first one it's also extremely emotional at times and really has a touching message!"
"Horrible! Working WAY too hard trying to be funny."
"Wow critics score and audience score is almost on an equal level. A suprise to be sure but a hilarious.Anyway the movie is fun to watch but the first one was a lot better. Depends what u expect the movie is pretty boring for the first 45min after that it starts getting better"
"My seven year old daughter loved it but the teens did not."
"The Lego Movie 2 was a fun time but it just wasn't as good as the first one. The sister's characters weren't as interesting or developed as the ones from the first movie and most of them weren't even legos! This movie doesn't have the same charm as the first one but it brings back all of the great characters from the first one and makes for an enjoyable experience."
"This sequel has great moments of action and comedy but is not as good as its predecessor basically due to the plot. They wanted to expand the universe with new characters that were not sufficiently justified and some moments felt out of place or meaningless like a hole in the plot."
"This movie is not as good as the first but it has a lot of fun references a good story with good twists and I personally had a blast seeing it in theatres. I recommend this movie to all ages."
"This movie is wacky. This movie is fun. This movie has a far better story than it has any right to have."
"Lots of beautiful lessons to be learnt here for kids and an intellectual (dare I add political) depth that adults will enjoy too! This film surpasses it� 1/2(TM)s predecessor in conjuring up the feels and laughs. Simplistic in design Queen Watevra Wa� 1/2(TM)Nabi� 1/2(TM)s animation is truely incredible and a marvel to watch! Bravo! 10/10"
"I expected more of the funny entertaining and fun LEGO story telling like the original however the sequel puts storytelling and comedy second to pushing a feminist agenda in a movie aimed at kids."
"The movie had many great jokes and crazy references cool characters in crazy situations and fun music but somehow it just didn't come together. It got so boring in the middle that the little kids started acting up in the theater. The end was very good and sort of made it worth watching but only in hindsight so not at all."
"First movie was better but this one is ok too. I would prefer to have different heroes not rehashing everyone from original movie. It felt repetitive."
"Terrible message. It's just more feminist agenda being taught to our children."
"while not as good as the first one still a decent movie with mostly good jokes. There was one joke in particular that made no sense where Rex steals Wonder Woman's jet and Wonder woman then says 'my lasso was in there' I do not understand what is supposed to be funny about this joke and the punchline doesn't work at all but other than this one joke it was an above average film."
"I was ok the first movie was better"
"Enjoyed the integration of the human and lego world much more in this one than the first one."
"Pretty poor boring unfunny. Best part was the credits!"
"It definitely wasn� 1/2(TM)t as good as the 1st Lego movie. It was pretty boring."
"A fun kids movie burdened by the expectations of the first that at times drags but ultimally provides an entertaining movie."
"The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part  Initial Reaction: How does it fit with the first part? Main Characters Emmet Brickowski Wilstyle/Lucy: Two master builders voiced by Chris Pratt and Elizabeth Banks. Batman: Yeah that guy. He�(TM)s voiced by Will Arnett.

Emmet goes on a rescue mission but almost gets demolished in space. Another master builder Red Dangervest saves Emmet and agrees to help him rescue his friends.  SCORING Main Characters They aren�(TM)t as good as they were in the original but they�(TM)re still funny and have great chemistry. SCORE: 8 Supporting Cast I found some of the new characters really interesting. The Queen has some good moments a swell as a female warrior who captures Emmet�(TM)s friends. SCORE: 8 Plot I enjoyed the ride that Emmet goes on to save his friends and there�(TM)s a really nice twist in the plot leading to a satisfying conclusion. SCORE: 9 Originality This film takes your usual �hero goes to save the day�? and gives it a few nice tweaks and adjustments. SCORE: 8 Violence Factor There�(TM)s a bit of fighting between Emmet�(TM)s gang and the outsiders but is seems that nobody gets blasted into little LEGO pieces like they do in the LEGO games. SCORE: 8 Other Moral Issues At the center of this story is a sweet tale on how two siblings can get along. And it also shows how different groups of toys can work together to find common ground. SCORE: 9Final Score (out of 60): 50 % Score: 83.33% It may not be as great as the original but it still has a lot of the LEGO magic in it."
"This was just bad. If I could give it 0 stars I would. It was NOT awesome. The ending was the best where they had the credits.Overall the movie was just boring and badly written. It didn't have the catchiness of the first movie. Sure there was the subplot about brother's and sister's not playing well together. But that kept interfering with the Lego movie. I was done after 1/2 hour of this soul-sucking movie. The marriage part - I just couldn't."
"It just a really fun movie with a lot of surprise jokes. Also glad they kept with the all lego theme."
"A great continuation of the original story. Funny Easter eggs and cameos. Take your kids and have fun!!!"
"honestly the kitten... pretty hot dude"
"Not as clever as the original. The music is pretty good though."
"I love this movie so much the animation is incredible and the story is good as well the music is stuck in my head since I watched the movie days ago."
"I really enjoy this movie! It has catchy songs nice plot and funny moments. Even though it still not as good as the original one this movie is definitely worth watching."
"I loved this movie so much! Far better than the first. It's not perfect but it's story hit me in all the right ways and I shed a few (maybe more) tears."
"YES YUP PLEASE DO MORE OF THIS"
"Boring... Just a few good scenes... Fell asleep for a while in the theater.The premise is stale now."
"Not as great as its predecessor but still a descent film. The voice actors give it there all in this film and it shows. The Animation is spectacular just like the first film. But this second just wasn't a home run for me. The villain was predictable there were no real surprises this time around and it feels like this film was more of a kids film then the original. Kids will love this sequel but adults might be left a little disappointed"
"The worst movie I have ever watched!"
"Not as good as the first. Not even close. the kids in the audience seemed to have fun though and I guess that's the point."
"EVERYTHING IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! expet feminisim"
"Lacking everything that made the original so well original and funny and irreverent the second part feels like the fun was sucked out of it. As the song goes everything is not so awesome which perfectly sums up the movie. And to boot almost anyone that follow politics and understands toxic masculinity will understand why this movie is certified fresh...well might as well convert em while they're young:)"
"In a couple words this movie is confusing and heartless.. Such a far cry from the freshness and theme of the first movie."
"Worst movie I have ever seen it� 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s almost like this movie is for kids..."
"Slow and lacked the cameos and surprises of the first film and to. A lesser degree than the Lego Batman movie. Wait for the home release."
"The LEGO Movie 2 was quite a splendid film not as good as its precedent but still has a good storyline and funny as ever the LEGO Movie 2 is a great film."
"This Movie Is colorful heart worming unbelievable animation and the humor is so funny but not as good as the first movie!"
"This film follows on from the first and sticks with the original characters developing them and progressing their relationships. You see them go through ridiculous adventures and crack some pop culture reference jokes. The film was decent and worth the watch if you like the first one and if you haven�(TM)t then you can still see it. However the songs are annoying and childish and it�(TM)s defintely centred towards children. The film�(TM)s first half isn�(TM)t very good and you wonder where it�(TM)s all going but it picks up in the second half. Overall a decent film but if you want to wait until it comes out then you�(TM)re not missing out on the best film of the year."
"Entretenida comica con mucho de fondo llena de referencias graciosas. Grandiosa pelicula."
"The Second Part lives up to the original while adding other awesome characters and heart-warming moments."
"Honestly it� 1/2(TM)s 100% better than the first movie but is also stupider"
"would not want to see this movie - Critics have no idea what the public movie goer wants too see"
"What a disappointing follow up to the original Lego Movie (and Lego Batman). The jokes were few and far between and were consistently predictable and fell flat. The only thing that was mildly entertaining was the Legos in 'real life' scenarios. Even the Batman scenes were a letdown. I'd watch the original Lego movie and the Batman Lego movie 10 times before re-watching this one."
"Horrible Movie not for kits."
"The first movie didn't do it for me but this one I actually liked."
"I liked this movie more than the first one. I was laughing out loud in the theater and so were the kids and the grandparents. Equally good humor. I wasn't a huge fan of all the musical numbers because I liked the storyline but that is not to say that the musical numbers where bad�" we downloaded the soundtrack right after leaving and have been singing the songs nonstop in the house. I loved seeing the two extremes of a boy playing with LEGOs and a girl playing with LEGOs and merging the worlds together. Appealed to everyone. My son keeps begging to go back to see it again in the theater!"
"The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part is a superb follow-up to the original film that lives up to the years�(TM) worth of hype surrounding it. Vibrant voice talent including new standouts and quippy writing make for a cartoon genre-defying blast. Any fans of the LEGO franchise must check this out.The movie follows five years since �everything was awesome�? as the citizens of Bricksburg suffered irreparable damage from the forces of LEGO DUPLO invaders. Bricksburg descended into Apocolaypseburg where the citizens brood. Luckily Emmet (Chris Pratt) always retains hope even when General Mayhem (Stephanie Beatriz) captures many of his friends. This takes Emmet on a journey across multiple unexplored worlds including a central DUPLO musical land as the fate of the LEGO galaxy relies upon him.The ensemble cast not only features one role from Chris Pratt as of course Emmet but also as Rex Dangervest. He continues to shine as Emmet with the reluctant hero taken to deeper territories as his hope to regain his friends is tested. Rex Dangervest shines and is my favorite character as he remains a charming presence and even mirrors many of Pratt�(TM)s roles in Hollywood. His relevance to the plot also provides for some mind-bending revelations. Elizabeth Banks as Lucy/Wyldstyle continues in her heartfelt buddy dynamic with Emmet as she even wants him to do something more intimidating. This proves for an interesting drive in his quest to find Lucy. New additions from Stephanie Beatriz and Tiffany Haddish are welcome ones with their unique DUPLO builds taking the spotlight. In particular Tiffany Haddish as Queen Watevra Wa�(TM)Nabi shines with her malicious intent and deceitful musical numbers. Will Arnett Allison Brie and Charlie Day return from the previous movie and continue their signature work with all even having a moment to shine amid this gigantic cast. Mike Mitchell spectacularly directs the movie with a great mastery of unconventional animation found within that pans out beautifully. Also Phil Lord and Christopher Miller return with a script that might even be funnier and more meta than the original. My favorite scene is the musical number between Batman and Queen Watevra Wa�(TM)Nabi that is just a true showcase of this series�(TM) unique sense of meta-commentary and humor. My problems with the movie do stem from the real world scenes. Even though the dynamics between siblings Finn (Jadon Sand) and Bianca (Brooklynn Prince) is a very touching and even humorous one it just doesn�(TM)t lead to much and feels tacked on with the time gap seeming like something of an afterthought. The message of this film is that everything will not always be awesome but in times like those we must always let people in and help others as much as we can. I give this film 4.5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 6 to 18.Reviewed by Arjun N. KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews by youth visit kidsfirst dot org."
"This movie was better then I expected it had hummer heart and some pretty cool fight scenes and the plot twist at the end made for an amazing ending. I'm interested to see if Warner Brothers would make a LEGO Movie 3."
"Took the kids and really enjoyed this movie. In some ways even better than the first one. I laughed plenty at silly jokes. Not a bunch of adult humor hidden behind anything. Just silly fun jokes."
"It was ok but nothing really new to see in this one that was not in the first one or the batman lego movie. Kids will probably like it just fine."
"SPOILER WARNING!!!!!The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part continues on from where the first film left us The Duplon invading BrickBurgs and stars the same cast which include Chris Pratt Elizabeth Banks Will Arnett Tiffany Haddish Stephanie Beatriz Alison Brie Nick Offerman Charlie Day Maya Rudolph and Will Ferrell. This movie I found is a massive improvement from the first (even the first is close to being a cinematic masterpiece). When I was looking through the reviews people were saying that Lego Movie 2 Everything is an ad. Ignore these idiots. When I viewed in the thereates I heard people laughing most of the way through and saying that it was a great film. The film gives us lots and lots of brilliant humour throughout which made this film truly wonderful. The funniest character was Batman because in this film Batman said loads of references which were based on previous Batman films and that won me over. A flaw I had with the movie is MetalBeard. I found the character very underused and he didn�(TM)t make that great humour that he did in the first so instead we got most of humour from The Dark Knight (Batman). Warner Bros yet again brings us a great villain which wasn't as good as President Business but still a great villain. The real reason why I loved the villain was because of the unexpected plot twist with him. The villains name is Rex and he is basically the future Emmett. Even though Rex didn't have anything to do with the main plot his motive throughout the last half of the movie was the real side to him and the last act was when he was the villain this I what I truly loved about this character. When I viewed this film I thought that Queen Waterva Wa'Nabi and General Mayhem were the actual villains of the movie because Emmett had a nightmare about Mamagedon happening and believe that those characters were the cause of it going to happen. The song this song gonna get stuck inside your head was a very catchy song which people could bang their heads to. When the song was played for the first time Batman was flossing and when he did the CGI for him was terrible. The references were one of the best parts of the movie. I very much enjoyed the sub plot between the family who had the LEGO because that brought the film into much more depth and made it more exciting.As being a huge Batman fan I was able to spot all the references about Batman's previous films and when those references came on I laughed so hard. When Batman was singing in the background I noticed the most legendary thing ever Heath Ledger's Joker he is very hard to miss so you might want to watch it carefully so you are then able to spot it. I also spotted some Back to the Future references. When Rex dies his death was like when Marty started fading at The Enchantment Under The Sea Dance this reference is said in the movie so it is pretty easy to spot to those Back to the Future fans out there. There is another Back to the Future reference which is about the DeLorean. When Rex talks about his backstory and says about his ship and how he made it there is a reference about the DeLorean. The last reference that I am going to point out is when gandalf says about Marvel not returning their calls. I know that isn't really classed as a movie reference but it will make Marvel Fans laugh out loud. There are much more references that you might be able to stop when you view this film for the very first time.Overall The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part is a lot more funny than its predecessor it has more catchy songs other than Everything is Awesome has a great villain and has a very good plot. Go watch Lego Movie 2 it is a brilliant film."
"It won't make you smarter but it might help you learn compassion. But i was glad that it delivered plenty of laughs. I only went to see the star puke glitter but laughed almost the whole way through. Everything you'd want in a modern family comedy."
"Better than the first."
"I laughed in delight and cried at how well this movie dealt with the pains of growing up. A witty/ callback filled script just oozes joy for the astute viewer. Plus some killer fun songs and a good message that it� 1/2(TM)s not awesome all the time but we can all do the best we can� 1/2(TM)t"
"The pieces are falling apart."
"Everything is awesome including this movie!"
"Cash grab. Just awful ... 85%!?! And Alita only got 60% ... shows how much film critics know... then again apparently this page is Yelp anymore."
"Amazing and almost hysterical!!!"
"This song is gonna get stuck inside your head! Great fun family film. Worthy sequel to tne awesome Lego Movie"
"For me as an older brother this new adventure in the Lego Canon was even more intimate and emotional than the first one. It really made me happy!!"
"Fun for the whole family. Kids won't stop listening to the soundtrack. Great story with a lot of heart."
"The Lego 2 is funnier than the first Lego movie if that is possible."
"Remember in the first film how it was an interesting twist that the LEGO world was a parallel? Okay good. Now that plot point is explained in the intro. Then five minutes in. Then halfway in. Then the whole ending. Otherwise carries humor and charm like the other LEGO films. Great to watch with kids.TLDR Reality plit point used too much. Good humor. Watch with Kids."
"I went into this thinking it was a kids' movie but alas it was a thinly veiled liberal agenda piece DISGUISED as a kids' movie. I think they got more in than the last movie: veganism reusable straws feminism & girl power Oprah mention weak/stupid/evil males even Ruth Bader Ginsburg? Liberal propaganda at its finest. I like my movies without politics thank you. At least the animation was good."
"Best credits I have ever seen. Didn't watch the rest."
"If you loved first movie as an adult you will be disappointed. No plot. Limited jokes. Good for young kids. My favorite part was the song during the closing credits. I was SO disappointed with the whole thing. Went as a family with two teens. We all loved the first one and hated this one."
"Basically on par with the original but with a slightly better ending"
"So Smart So Funny So Meta. Loved it."
"Just as good if not better than the first. Musical numbers were phenomenal. Not a fan of Hadish but her role here was great."
"Great feel good movie lots of quick gags and a clever plot. As with most sequels doesn't quite hit the heights of the first movie but still brilliant stuff."
"Some of the novelty of the Lego films' USP has certainly been lost which is a great shame but this sequel maintains a lot of the original's charm whilst also inheriting some of its problems problems made worse because they've come round again. Like its predecessor the film's strengths lie in its jokes and its visuals. Its weaknesses lie in its bland protagonists that do little more the second time around to endear you to them as anything more than vehicles for jokes (a role better served by the film's many side characters). The film is fast loud and colourful and in some ways it made me feel old but it certainly retains the charm and creativity that made the first film such a hit for all ages.Also you'll be sick of 'Everything is Awesome' by the end but the film has several new songs that exceed anything from the first including a wonderful villain song. Make sure you pay attention during the credits for a song that deconstructs the very concept of end credits itself."
"We have said this beforeand we will say it again.Lightning never strikes twice.The first movie was a huge hit.with great cast and crew membersit would only be a matter of time before it got a sequel.This movie is great.Beautiful colorsand amazing animationmakes it almost better than the original."
"Super po� 1/2 1/2 1/2� 1/2 1/2 1/2...czenie animacji filmu przygody i codziennego � 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/4ycia. polecam"
"Fun movie. More then just Will Ferrell's voice in it would have would have been nice."
"Fun but very slow at times."
"Good movie i like it"
"It was definitely more fun than the last one but only maybe because it added a bit more 4th wall-breaking this time. Nonetheless the first one is still my favourite."
"A film that is generally fun but no where near the original when it comes to humour plot and cleverness. There are a number of laugh out loud moments and the music is as imaginative as the first film. However because of the twist in the original the cat is somewhat out of the bag when it comes to the �reality�? of the story - ie the brother/sister/parent interactions. The moral �message�? of the film is also about as subtle as being smacked over the head with a mallet and while I�(TM)m generally in agreement with the idea of listening to each other and trying to build a better world whilst acknowledging that everything isn�(TM)t awesome is the right way to go please can we stop portraying the male characters a stupid babies in need of a sensible/strong females to fix everything? This undermines the whole ethic of the film - if we do value what we all bring to the world then we shouldn�(TM)t need to blame everything on men and their immaturity. Maybe I�(TM)m reading too much into it but I did feel I was being lectured in the last third of the film. My 2 kids enjoyed it although my 12 year old definitely recognised it lacks the magic of the first while my 7 year old enjoyed the appropriate silly bits and the music - and Batman �Flossing�?!I�(TM)d imagine this isn�(TM)t the last we will see of the Lego franchise but maybe it should be. It�(TM)s worth a look but you could wait for the DVD or download."
"Everything is still pretty awesome in this Lego Movie sequel. It's a fun movie with clever jokes and adult humor throughout to keep the grown-ups amused and the initial ending credits song is like no other."
"The LEGO Movie 2 is better than the original-funny entertaining and awesome-more than ever known before!"
"While maybe not as good as the first "The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part" still manages to deliver a fun and entertaining time while also including a great message and some great comedy as well."
"Oh da pain! :( This movie was not as well written as the original. The "jokes" do not land this time. The smart mysteries of kragle taco Tuesday and president business do exist or are obvious in this movie."
"Four adults went to see this today. All of us thought it was a waste of our time and money and not nearly as good as the first one."
"This movie is so awkward disturbing. My real question is why are there so many adults in this movie and no kids?"
"The sum of its parts are greater than the whole and though (unsurprisingly) not as good as the first worth the price of admission! Ultimately the moral is a slugger that hits ya right in the heart and is built up to well.The biggest flaw is likely it's simply not as funny though a good chunk of jokes have that ambitious flair synonymous with the original. (Though the musical element brings it down to a diet level of cringe) Admittedly though meta jokes (and there are a lot) that landed with me did not seem to shmooze the audience as much. New characters are somewhat...confusing?...though enjoyable?? Characterization and motivation could have been thought about more though I got no complaints about the old cast. The film maintains the child-like logic and plot structure of the first but it at times works to its disadvantage and hurts the pacing in a Convenient Plot Device kind of way (though I have no issues with Rex's C.P.D.) And yeah I know I'm kinda flaming a movie about Legos but yeah I feel like it's a quality enough franchise to be doing this WOULD RECOMMEND 3.75 STARS."
"Amazing movie with a great but long forgotten message of hope and courage. Its great to finally see a movie again where the heroes realize that being cynical and brooding doesn't make you a "realist". It makes you a weak coward. The real strong and brave ones are those who realize the world isn't perfect but also know that by working together we can keep the real monsters at bay and always make the world a little better each day. We need more movies like that again."
"Tried to be like the first but fell short."
"Very funny and had lots of heart and a deep message."
"Not as great of as the first one but still pretty good."
"This movie was awesome. It had great animation like the first movie and a very endearing and clever plot. The new villain Rex was probably the best villain of the Lego franchise. 4.5/5"
"Probably the worst Kids movie experience I have had in a Loooong time....and I saw Smallfoot and the new Grinch.....one critic said it took a while to get going but I must have been asleep by then....do not waste your time...."
"An awesome sequel. The message behind it was just as hard hitting as the message behind the first. The movie's self awareness and underlying messages paired with bright humor makes it a great watch. It brings the wild stories and complex characters created in our childhood onto the big screen and honestly scores a home run. Awesome movie."
"The first LEGO Movie was so good there� 1/2(TM)s a chance you don� 1/2(TM)t remember just how good it was. Not only did it tell a smart hilarious original story but it was filled with heart eventually revealing itself to be a deeper story of a boy and his bonding with his father. The movie was legitimately genius.That said going into The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part it felt like a long shot that the sequel could do it again. How could writers Phil Lord and Chris Miller once again tell a story that� 1/2(TM)s surprising funny works on multiple levels is simple enough for kids but also complex and meaningful for adults? That could never happen right? Well in a shocking twist it does. It really does.The LEGO Movie 2 is a hilarious clever emotional sequel that is almost on par with the brilliant original which is a very worthy achievement indeed. This and the first one (also LEGO Batman to an extent) have had truly deep and thoughtful scripts written by people who really care about what they are writing. If you enjoyed the first LEGO Movie you will most certainly enjoy the sequel. It� 1/2(TM)s a whole lot awesome with a whole lot of heart.P.S. Stay through the closing credits to experience a joyous and playful tune about� 1/2 the greatness of the closing credits."
"better than the first. watching as an adult you will be reminded of what it was like to be a kid. the wit sarcasm and self-effacing humor exceeds what was in the fist film."
"This movie does justice to its predecessor film sure not as fun but it contains good animation and good graphics for the whole family to enjoy"
"I'll come back with a review over three months when it comes to Blu-Ray because I could not focus on the movie at all because of the kids behind me. Among the worst cinema experiences."
"Lego Movie 1 was an unexpected delight. Wry and darkly subversive for adults fun and action for kids. The second one has totally abandoned the adults. I was bored and embarrassed that I was watching what is a pleasant but cliched pre-school children's film. Think Shrek 3 and let someone else take your kids if they want to see it."
"The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part is not quite as good as the first one it still was a fantastic movie. The animation was super colorful and spectacularly well done. The voice over performances were terrific especially from Chris Pratt Tiffany Haddish Elizabeth Banks Will Arnett Stephanie Beatriz Alison Brie Charlie Day Nick Offerman Richard Ayoade and Ben Schwartz. The writing story and screenplay were great as well as very touching heartwarming and beautiful. The movie was funny and cute but not as funny as the first one. Also the music was amazing especially Catchy Song and Everything is Awesome (Tween Dream Remix)."
"This one didn�(TM)t have half the laughs of the earlier movies. Prepare yourself for a lot of musical numbers. I was disappointed."
"This movie is so terrible I just finished with the movie and wondered how I can get that two hours back. Please dont take your kids to watch this disaster."
"SUCH A GREAT MOVIE! only reason why this didn't make any money opening weekend is because it wasn't advertised sufficiently. Barely knew it was coming out & found out by chance. It was incredibly thoughtful and very funny. You could see how the feel changed from the 1st movie from the playfulness of a young adolescent boy to a younger girl. very cool. Oh and catchy music!"
"Back in 2014 I was blown away by how much I loved the first "LEGO Movie." It was a breath of fresh air with great humor and a story that moved at a superb pace. After the first film's success and multiple spinoffs it was only a matter of time before we got a direct sequel. I will say as a whole I liked "The Second Part." It's a cute movie that kids will definitely enjoy. It's full of fun animation and solid voice acting as well as more musical numbers this time around. I thought there was definitely less fun and cleverness for the adults in this movie. I thought there were some great jokes and references but the story felt much more childish here. I also thought the movie was somewhat poorly paced. The first half was actually somewhat boring for me. However this movie got a lot more entertaining about halfway through and I really enjoyed the second half. The heartfelt finale redeemed the movie and left me with a big smile. It's nowhere near as good as the first but I think it's a sweet movie you can watch with your family that left me in a good mood."
"Good movie great moral"
"i saw this movie and it's good"
"At first the plot is very simple and just silly. It really isn't until the last 10 minutes when there is a twist that shows mature depth and an important life lesson. Full of funny references and visual gags there is plenty to laugh at for all ages.You can read my full movie review at Movie Review Mom."
"'The Second Part' is endless fun with its tremendously high rapid-fire jokes per minute courtesy of Lord and Miller's air-tight script and again the dazzling CGI animation only adds to the film's charm with its endearingly choppy stop-motion style. The revelations of the final act don't pay off as well as the rest of the pretty much perfect film before it but as a whole 'The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part' is still an excellent surprisingly touching piece of greatness."
"The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part is one of the animations that begin 2019 very well as this film has a wonderful story and script by Phil Lord Christopher Miller and Matthew Fogel a magnificent direction by Mike Mitchell a spectacular voice cast consisting of Chris Pratt Elizabeth Banks Will Arnett Tiffany Haddish and Stephanie Beatriz and in addition in my opinion is better than the first film and deserves to be recognized by the Academy. In short as in the first film everything is awesome"
"I love it! So many funny jokes that you cannot even remember from laughing so hard. It makes you feel like a kid again."
"Although not as awesome and grand as the first one Lego Movie 2 : Second part still has a lot of fun to be enjoyed by kids kids at heart and the whole family."
"The movie is good but it would have been more awesome if there are more actions like master builder vs master breaker then have the usual great emotional ending with moral lessons :)"
"Absolutely the WORST movie my family has ever paid to see. Not even close."
"Kids will definitely LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie!! The movie is so creative & so colorful~ It is amazing they can build some incredible things just with lego. The story is also inspiring for the children to be good and have strong determination to achieve the goal. Over all very well done animation movie!!"
"Good but no where as good as the 1st. My rating is matine only"
"Everything is (Still) Awesome: The Sequel. Wasnt sure where it was going half way in but it soon clicked in to place ;)"
"I think we�(TM)ve forgotten how monumental The Lego Movie (2014) was. It kicked off one of the least likely film franchises. It cemented Chris Pratt as a lovable movie star. It continued the trajectory of directors Lord and Miller (Jump Street) as filmmakers who make terrible concepts into snarky brilliance. It proved that CGI can be more than sterile carbon copies of Pixar. But most of all it used self-referential humor and meta-commentary to honor imaginative play never kowtowing to either kids or adults serving them both equally. Unfortunately most of that celebratory creativity begins to fade in this chaotic and pale imitation of a sequel. When a race of Duplo-designed aliens transform Lego world into Apocalypseburg abducting some of its most notable citizens Emmet and Lucy have to lead an adventure to get their friends back. The meta-humor (�Marvel won�(TM)t return our calls��?) though fairly one note is still relatively funny. The songs of which there are much more are good. Pratt still shines as the oafish goofball hero all while sending up his other big franchise roles. Otherwise throughout the meat of the film the kinetic plot and comedic brilliance is much less effective and simply less funny.By the end some story re-positioning works to positively reset everything previous. It really leans into the real-world youth master-builders story more cleverly playing with the line between their playtime and their imaginative Lego world revealing a welcome sweetness. But by the time the characters spout off the morals through lame monologues we�(TM)re left wondering why they couldn�(TM)t just leave well-enough alone. Let�(TM)s just stick with Lego Batman sequels from here on out deal?"
"- I knew this wasnt going to be as good as the first one. But this was a funhilarious and entertaining film that surpassed all my expectations. Chris Pratt as both Emmet and Rex Dangervest was fantastic. Their characters had great chemistry and I loved seeing them together. Rex stole the show whenever he was onscreen. The supporting characters werent as strong as the first movie butthey were still entertaining and charismatic.The writing was great thanks to the talents of Phil Lord and Chris Miller."
"Not as good as the first one but it was good. My kids really enjoyed it.Like the first movie this movie did a great job capturing how the story and action in the lego world mirror how kids play. For me I thought the first lego movie was the best Lego Batman was a close second and this is a close third."
"it was a good movie it had a lot of plot twists I'm not going to say it and when you watch it there's a song that's going to be stuck inside your head"
"This is one of the best sequels ever - period. As long as you are not a bitter old man that doesn't understand that this is a movie for children directed by two goofballs not Steven Spielberg starring a goofball (Pratt) not Marlon Brando you'll probably like it. The jokes are less annoying and penetrating and for sure less forced than in the first movie (and certainly way less everything than in the LEGO Batman Movie) the story is way less random with an actual start middle and finish (unlike the LEGO Batman where they seemed to run out of time and just made up something at the end) and although not as capturing as the new Netflix show in 17 seasons it's still well balanced and pleasantly flowing. The live action was surprisingly believable probably because they didn't have to force in screen time for Will Ferrell the animation bits are made just as good as it gets these days. Everyone who doesn't agree that this movie is a blast to watch because of the animation alone is lying.The biggest surprise is not even the at least for me unexpected plot twist but the fact how seemlesly believably and simple the two main worlds (boys and girls toys) were mixed to create a logic universe. This could have gone so wrong (I even read somewhere that this movie is made to embarise men) and instead with General Mayhem we get a really cool antagonist that is apealing across genders and probably cooler than Batman.Look I get that noone was waiting for this sequel but if you are honest noone was waiting for the first Frozen movie either. It's a light entertainlemt easy to digest apealing for kids with a soundtrack that doesn't make you want to peel the skin off your skull with music bits that don't make you roll eyes like in some movies by the big D. with some genuine laugh out loud moments a movie that creates a perfect mix of two genders that will apeal to girls and boys alike one that parents can let the kids see without having to be scared what junk will be fed to them and one that's simply innocent."
"Touching and funny film."
"The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part didn't live up to expectations and doesn't match up with the first one. This one follows Emmet and a new face to the lego universe "Rex Danger Vest". Wildstyle Unikitty etc are captured as you follow Emmet and Rex in an epic comical beautiful musical journey while also looking the love of brothers and sisters and their voew on Lego's. Though i dont think it is better than the first one I had a great time and had a lot of laughs. It's fun for the whole family and even appeals to a more grown-up audience."
"Still very charming and wholy original but far from the perfection of its predecessor."
"Great movie! Twists and turns unexpected moments and overall a heart-warming story!"
"Not a single laugh was heard during the movie in a fairly full theatre. Dismally poor in almost every way my kids were bored by half-way through. This is a terrible movie."
"Me and your mum went to see it. Great film. Really enjoyed Emmett's character as he was very groovy and gnarly dood. Your mum was enjoying the film too. But she said that emmett was not good at lego so he should not be a full on lego master"
"Wonderful movie all around. It had more heartwarming elements than the first one but had a good share of comedy. The story perfectly fits the reveal of the first movie and they work it in perfectly. If only I could give this movie ten stars out of five."
"You see when I rate my movies I think to myself � 1/2Does this have a solid story line?� 1/2�? Or � 1/2Does it have good character development?� 1/2�?Well this movie has it all much to the oringinal LEGO Movie this is a delegate way to take something perfect...and recreate it ..to something that almost perfect. Don� 1/2(TM)t get me wrong no movie is perfect and every movie has its downfalls but most movies have its upsides and that� 1/2(TM)s what this movie is a mix! I saw this movie and enjoyed it it wasn� 1/2(TM)t boring or something you sleep through..No..it� 1/2(TM)s a masterpiece it was beautifully made and that� 1/2(TM)s why this movie gets a 5 1/2 star."
"Algumas musicas são muito boas ele nao e muito engraçado mas aquele final me surpreendeu"
"Even though it still contains enough laughter and story to keep things interesting The Second Part ultimately ruined the potential of a great franchise by overusing what makes its predecessor great and completely throw any unpredictability out of the window without any emotional gratification."
"The perfect sequel. The fun themes started in the first movie are expanded upon and deepened. The plot is interesting and surprising you'll laugh a lot and might even feel touched. Highly recommended."
"my eyes and ear died"
"This movie was good not as great as the first. The first was one of the funniest movies I seen but this movie has the same jokes as the first. So it was not as funny. The story was great. the additional voices that were not in the original were awesome choices. And the songs were soooooo good.-80%"
"It was good but not as good as the first one or Lego Batman Movie."
"So cute and adorable! Lego movie 2 is the perfect sequel to the first movie. This songs gonna get stuck inside yo head!!! The message is great for kids as well as adults! Cute characters. Funny lies for the adults. Go see it and laugh away!"
"Kids and I loved it! Just enough humor to keep us laughing till the end!"
"i� 1/2(TM)ll Answer that! Yes it� 1/2(TM)s VERY beautiful!!!Amazing visuals! Perfect cast! Hilarious cameos! Lord and Miller have done it again! Unthinkable twists and heaps of heart! Brilliant.I need to see it again to catch all the details!"
"This Movie made the Top Box Office of 2019 made over 34.5M dollars like I thought just 4.3M dollars but wow this movie might be a great hit when it gets nominated in a few months."
"lets' face it this isn't as spectacular as the first moviebut the filmmakers still have all the essential ingredients to make it a fun goofy ride for kids and for the familiesstill so many bits of clever humor inside jokes and references of the property and still some heartfelt lessons for everyone to grab ontothe cast is bigger following in the steps of Chris Pratt Elizabeth Banks Will Arnett with new players like Tiffany Haddish as Queen Watevra Wa'Nabiheck Pratt even has more fun playing two roles poking fun at another infamous role from another franchise which makes it that much more hilariouspicking up right where the last one left off with the kid's little sister coming down to play with his LEGO toys and his imagination the tone changes entirelythe block toddler Duplon toys invade and battle everybody turning it into Apocalypseburg; an apocalyptic wasteland after 5 years where Wildstyle is too busy brooding and assessing the reality of the grim world while Emmet is remaining cheerful and hopeful everything can still be awesomethe bad guys are from the Sistar System (you can see where this going) where everything is sparkly happy-go-lucky and overly-enthusiasticEmmet has to learn to grow-up and save Wildstyle and his friends but also discover a part of himself he never knewthe film feels much more frantic this time the pacing is much quicker the inside references are still silly as they can be from Justice League to Twilight to Jurassic World to Back to the Future to even Batman's solo film and even if it isn't as affecting as the ending of the first film it's still a good way to absorb its intentionsI really do love Tiffany Haddish playing the Queen and her changing forms trying to hide that villainous facadeis it better to grow up or stay as you are with heart and compassion? hardening your heart is super easy but opening it up to everyone else is much tougher if everyone shares what they have we can all come together and build a better world yes everything isn't awesome or perfect yet we can still make it the way we want or hope it to be someday it's okay to be open to new ideastrue this is tough to match the success of the previous film but it's still all good fun not just for youngsters but also adults who appreciate some serious storytelling"
"A kids' movie with jokes and plot that adults can also enjoy. The bravely accurate metaphor to all of today's political wedgies are refreshing to see. Genius. American activists should use this movie as a teachable moment on how to reunite as a liberal icon to leads the world toward a better place (and not censorship segregation and violence)."
"Yes! Spledd movie. An extended of the original but still plays well with its humor and visuals"
"This movie looks really good.. i am might see it online.. but this movie looks awesome!!! who would not want to see this??!!"
"Not as good but still good."
"Personally I think this movie was equal to the 1st.. Maybe even better."
"It is very enjoyable and very cute with batman of course being the best part"
"I've been waiting for years for the return of my favourite characters and the LEGO movie 2 does NOT disappoint! LEGO has really outdone themselves with this heart filled and funny instant classic. I was happy to see the return of Emmett unikitty Benny (who as disco Benny stole my heart) and Batman but loved the whimsical new characters. Tiffany Haddish was perfect as Queen Whatever Wa-Nabi and Maya Rudolph was the PERFECT choice as live action Mom! Watching the movie in the theatre with kids was the best as both parents and kids alike were laughing out loud throughout! Go see this film!!"
"I don´t know why critics are hating this movie it is not a perfect movie but it is a very entertaining one which has very clever jokes the only problem being that sometimes it relies on pop culture jokes."
"A must see at any change. The creativity and design are at brilliant at the first LEGO Movie. The story is fresh. It recaptures the heart of being a child!"
"The Lego movie 2 the second part was a wonderful movie. However my one complaint would be that the plot twist can be extremely confusing."
"Funny but still a cheesy kids movie. Did not really enjoy how much the live action was a part of the movie."
"Loved this fantastic second part It's full of fun and laughter and has at least one catchy song :) . I'd highly recommend it to any LEGO fan it's well worth a watch."
"Everything is even AWESOMER!!!! Heart warming and beautiful.. with all the creativity and charm of the first LEGO Movie and more. So happy to finally see Mini Dolls in a LEGO movie Especially Sweet Mayhem and Balthazar. LEGO are embracing girls that build. YOU ROCK LEGO!!! Absolutely loved it... This movie will get stuck inside your heart!!!! :)"
"Good movie music is not my scene compared to the first one. Funny and dark at times. Bruce Willis makes for a good movie!"
"Not as fun Fresh or interesting as the first however it is still enjoyable and has a nice fun twist. After the viewing of the movie 1/2(TM)d say that no more lego movies should be made"
"The LEGO Movie 2 provides a fun exquisite visual effect and heartfelt time at the movies. What a thoroughly enjoyable experience."
"First time I saw the Lego Movie I was completely surprised by the amount of ingenuity depth humor and heart it came with. A film about toys transcending the plastic pieces to comment on relationships between families and their shared connections. The sequel is no different. The cast is humorous and well played the VFX's and animations are life-like yet completely cartoonish when they need to be and the story remains at it's core about family. While the 'whiz-bang' magic of the first one is long gone (with the first Lego film and the impressive Lego Batman film out of the way) the film remains consistent in entertainment and message.Definitely worth your (and your kids) time and money. Everything is still awesome."
"A great continuation of the first movie with a lot of jokes and a lot of heart. If you enjoyed the first one you won't regret seeing the second one! Great new characters and beautiful LEGO visuals that you wouldn't have expected to see!"
"Sequels are always difficult but this one keeps up with its predecessor in every way! A fun storyline with some unexpected twists and even a few musical numbers you will get stuck inside your head for days to come! This is one of the few movies I suggest multiple viewings in theaters for to catch every little detail thrown into the story and visuals."
"Everything is definitely still awesome!!! -loved it!"
"Awesome sequel different to the first movie great to see LEGO break the mould and do something new and exciting. Fantastic soundtrack and some exciting new characters. Lots of laugh out loud funny moments for everyone. We were a very mixed age range going to see it and we all loved it. Too many favourite bits to mention although Gotham City Guys in my opinion is brilliant. Stay for the titles at the end another great movie moment very clever. Go see it it'll make you smile. Already planning to see it again as want to see what I missed when I was laughing. Well done LEGO. � 1/2 1/2 1/2~� 1/2 1/2� 1/2�?� 1/2 1/2 1/2~� 1/2 1/2� 1/2�?� 1/2 1/2 1/2~� 1/2 1/2� 1/2�?� 1/2 1/2 1/2~� 1/2 1/2� 1/2�?� 1/2 1/2 1/2~� 1/2 1/2� 1/2�?"
"The question is without the first Lego Movie's element of surprise and low expectations can Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (now only as writers and producers) repeat their success with the Second Part 5 years later. Happily I can say for the most part the answer is yes as I giggle along to this heart-warming and entertaining sequel which follows directly on from the first one's live action twist when we find out that the crazy mismatched Lego world in which the movie was set in is actually Will Ferrell's dad's huge basement Lego playset being reimagined by his then 8 years old son Finn. For the sequel we see the arrival of Finn's younger sister Bianca and her Duplo invaders which has turned Bricksberg into the Mad Max wasteland that is Apocalyspeburg. Once again letting their imagination run wild everything and the kitchen sink are thrown into the mix with new colourful and sparkling characters mingling with returning favourites that will dazzle the younger audience while knowingly self-referential digs poking fun at everything from Chris Pratt's career to the different incarnations of Batman will keep the adults entertained. Following the success of Everything is Awesome they have also doubled down on the musical numbers with Broadway worthy songs and catchy earworms that will get stuck inside your head. This is a cute film that's not going to break any new grounds and it will always be the underachieving cheeky cousin to the Toy Story franchise but it is decently and funnily constructed and there's even an element of sophistication in the underlying message it's making wholesome and corny though it may be. Above all it's still miles better than anything one can expect from a movie based on a bunch of plastic bricks."
"As sporadic as its predecessor thankfully. Therefore when it hits its voids it's really felt. Still the parallel stories are smartly woven."
"A very good movie endlessly clever but lacking in volume of true laughter"
"Everything is still AWESOME!"
"Similar to another recent animated sequel ("Ralph Breaks The Internet") "The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part" in no way matches the amount of brilliance or novelty that its legendary predecessor possessed. "Not as good" is not the same as "not good at all" however and this film definitely contains a lot to like and even love. The thematic backbone of this story namely is one of the more admirable and unique features in play featuring some genuinely effective heart and a truly affecting message that should strike an emotional chord with most viewers. The humor while definitely nowhere near as polished and indelible as the first film is still worthy of note featuring a couple of real banger jokes and a multitude of other relatively funny ones. The music even gets a bit of an updo this time utilizing the decidedly hilarious musical talents of one Jon Lajoie to its added benefit. Again none of this is particularly better than the original but still valid at most. Just don't expect lightning to strike the same place it did back in 2014."
"Just saw it in the theater with my husband and son. We all were huge fans and there are no bigger Lego fans in existence. We all thought the movie was pretty great (not as good as the first one- but still really great). We thought the music was catchy the jokes were funny the animation was great and it was definately worth going to see."
"Definitely not near as good as the first movie. I found myself very bored and the children in the theater were definitely bored as well. Not engaging not surprising this movie was too predictable."
"I had some legitimately high hopes for this film and damn am I disappointed. The first LEGO Movie is honestly in my top ten animatedly movies of all time. It shouldn't have worked but it did because of amazing writers behind the project Phil Lord and Chris Miller. Both of them also wrote the sequel and I honestly don't know what happened. This kind of feels like the film I was afraid The LEGO Movie was going to be. Filled with lazy jokes phoned in performances and a serious lack of creativity. It was honestly hard to keep my attention on the screen which is insane to me because of how captivating the first and LEGO Batman are. The only part that legitimately worked for me was the message. It is super heartfelt and sweet (although this may be biased because I saw it with my sister). I wanted to love this movie but the vast majority failed to even capture my attention. This is such a shame and the first blip on Lord and Millers previously flawless record. I would give this film a D+."
"I came in with big expectations because we loved the first movie. This movie had a strange story line and bad music."
"Wonderful follow up to the first that exceeded all my expectations. Had a great message about sibling relationships and brought back the same mix of humour and depth that children can understand that i� 1/2(TM)ve come to expect from lego movies."
"this movie "The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part"(2019) was JUST OK and not WORTH GOING to SEE IT but CHILDREN MAY or MAY NOT ENJOY GOING to SEE THIS. The around 20 minutes ENDING of this MOVIE WAS GREAT the BEST PART of this MOVIE. I saw this in Austin Texas on Monday 02/11/2019."
"the world building was not well thought out but the acting was pretty good and the premise was easy to follow with a sufficient amount of twists but just enough raw emotion to make you feel good when you leave the theater"
"Passable movie. I am perhaps a little disappointed by it but mostly because I expected it to live up to the original. It is fine little movie but it is a lot less original than the original and unfortunately also a lot less funny. The acting both the live action parts and the voice action is oddly phoned in."
"The entire first half I found to be incredibly predictable and formulaic but the ending pretty much made up for the entire film."
"It's too bad we had the Lego Batman and Lego Ninjago movies since the first Lego movie; I loved the first Lego movie but couldn't make it through either of the next 2. I have a six year old and three year old and the best part of this movie was taking my kids - they loved it and I laughed a lot. Yes it wasn't as fresh or exciting as the first time around but it was definitely a lot of good fun and I'm glad I got to experience it through the eyes of my kids."
"Very awesome movie the human parts in the movie were less cheesey than the first movie but still a little cheesey. As a guy who has both a brother and a sister the story was very relatable."
"Wow. I�(TM)m surprised this was as good as the first. Well done Lord and Miller."
"Another awesome Lego Movie! We have loved Lego Movie Lego Ninjago Lego Batman. Fun and funny for kids and adults and alike. Hilarious moments like Unikitty being scared turning into her rage alter ego and then Emmet zooming up beside them on a cute sounding vehicle. My kids and I watched that scene several more times on YouTube busting a gut. Thoroughly enjoyed! My seven year old son keeps asking if we can go see it again. :)"
"LOVED the other. One hope this one is also good."
"Not as good as the first."
"The first LEGO Movie was so good there� 1/2 1/2(TM)s a chance you don� 1/2 1/2(TM)t remember just how good it was. Not only did it tell a smart hilarious original story but it was filled with heart eventually revealing itself to be a deeper story of a boy and his bonding with his father. The movie was legitimately genius.That said going into The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part it felt like a long shot that the sequel could do it again. How could writers Phil Lord and Chris Miller once again tell a story that� 1/2 1/2(TM)s surprising funny works on multiple levels is simple enough for kids but also complex and meaningful for adults? That could never happen right? Well in a shocking twist it does. It really does.The Lego Movie 2 is a hilarious clever emotional sequel that is almost on par with the brilliant original which is a very worthy achievement indeed. This and the first one (also Lego Batman) have had truly deep and thoughtful scripts written by people who really care about what they are writing. If you liked the first Lego Movie I highly recommend this one.P.S. Stay through the closing credits to experience a joyous and playful tune about� 1/2 1/2 the greatness of the closing credits."
"It is as good as the first one"
"Worst movie ever. I would rather shit in my own hands and clap rather than watch this again."
"Surprisingly as good as the first!"
"It made me feel like a kid again. Thank you so much!"
"Not as great as the original no but was a fine enough sequel."
"Very well made movie with a great soundtrack that keeps the humorous yet emotional tones of the first film highly recommend"
"First Movie is much better. However this sequel is about as good as sequels get because I always feel for really good films it is always difficult to top the film that did well. Fun story really enjoyable and I personally found this film funnier than the original LEGO Movie. I also enjoyed and liked all the new characters introduced in this sequel. And it was nice to see old characters from the original film back in action the balance of old and new characters is good. Overall Fun enjoyable and well put together a worthy sequel 5/5 from me."
"Pretty pretty good but not as good as the first one."
"A Toy Story.The Lego Movie 2: The Second PartMitchell is clearly afraid to try anything new. Looped in the same process that we have already seen before this installment works on nothing but humor. And as always the humor has been ironical pointing out the obvious in each scenario it mocks down its own flaws and characters from all the sides. The references too helps in a lot a culmination of all iconic characters bubbles up the films TVs sports and pop cultural references that clearly is kept in mind in order to tickle its younger audience. And mind you it's not for that younger audience- for them the visual effects and action is enough to blow their minds- it is more armed towards the teenage audience.The musical sequences are my favorites especially the way they start. There is always one among them opposing to hum along the tune usually it's Banks. But personally for me Arnett's musical numbers makes me tickle the most. In fact his entire track is the highlight of the film. Not tied into any strings from the actual plot he is literally there to mock everyone. His attitude of not accepting his mistakes no matter how many time they ride that joke comes out hilarious.His entire image has gone topsy-turvy; he wears white cloak he is not a bachelor anymore and he sings and dance to all the beats and Haddish is the one to blame. Her character swoops in with charm and electrifies the whole screen like a concert. The non-animated part of the film is not only poorly performed but also shot with dull camera work that anchors the film. The emotions that it is trying to capture through it seems in-congruent to its tone we are so sunk in this tomfoolery world that sincerity grows into a myth and the makers should have been aware of it and should have toned it down a bit.Pratt voicing two characters this time is pretty much decent in his revisiting role but much more effecting in his newer suit. The endorsement he does of himself with such commitment and a "cool" voice does fool us along with the characters around him. Banks the voice of the reason gets to play the mellow part despite of having a completely different persona than any other characters she fails to stand out on her own merits "her character just isn't ready to change."Unlike the previous one there aren't lots of things going on in screen the makers have definitely minimized the plethora of characters version which helps us stay with the narration easily. The comments passed by famous stars every now and then steals the thunder of the scene like when everyone rushes down Batman's house Alfred yells "No shoes!" or Bruce Willis jumping in or an eerie equation of Superman and Green Lantern the film keeps us busy through these formulas and we all nod along effervescently. The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part is a step down for the franchise where it still might be worth playing with but the original essence is clearly missing."
"The LEGO movie 2 was an outstanding sequel including funny interesting and heart felt characters a wonderful cast and a great storyline. The animation was fantismal and the writing was amazing. The plot twists were fascinating and entertaining and I reccomend this movie to anybody of all ages"
"A great addition to The LEGO Movie series."
"I really liked it. Giggled all the way through and was moved to tears at one point. It's not as original as the first one obviously but it was thoroughly enjoyable."
"Loved this movie soooo much! Lovely heartwarming message! Laugh out loud moments.... Queen Watevra� 1/2 1/2(TM)s Song is possibly my fave villain song of all time! Move over Ursula !!! Had a tear in my eye at the end!!!! Hit me in all the feels!"
"Wonderful visuals and heartfelt story about siblings learning to get along. Clever story full of twists great female heroes and even positive messaging around growing up and staying kind. Also super funny gags."
"Lego 2 is a good movie to hang out."
"Back to the world of small plastic animated building blocks where imagination rules and the fourth wall is occasionally bumped elbowed and/or run straight through like a freshly-wiped sliding glass door. I guess I'm in the minority here but from my POV this played as a sequel that wasn't as fresh nor as inspired as the original.In the first film half the fun came from learning the rules of the world admiring a string of wildly different settings and identifying the slew of cheeky energetic celebrity cameos in a long parade of licensed characters. Every one of those elements is clamped down if not outright eliminated in the follow-up. It's funny it's entertaining there's a lot of winks for the parents and silly slapstick bits for the kids but as a whole it's much more forced and cramped. Although we spend time exploring new galaxies meeting alien queens and defending post-apocalyptic landscapes the universe is smaller and far less diverse. The same voice actors reprise the same roles for the same cameos but this time it's more of an obligation and less of a spontaneous surprise. "I know that guy!" becomes "I remember that guy."I don't want to sound too harsh here because the story does represent a logical continuation of simmering themes that were present in the original and the music is once again a major highlight but it's not a great sign when the film's most clever imaginative scene takes place during the credits. Maybe a growing pain for the franchise; there's still plenty of fertile ground here but it's going to take a little more effort to re-bottle that jolt of lightning."
"(Spoilers ahead)Great movie I really liked it. It was so intriguint and I liked the plot twist! It Blowed My mind! I was not expecting the �Aliens�? to be good and Rex to be emmet from the future! It was a really good movie I highly recommend it!"
"Manages to be frenetically paced and boring at the same time. Characters are shallow stereotypes plot is thin and horrible song sequences."
"It was so worth the wait."
"God was this a bad movie. My son and I loved Lego Movie 1. Way too dark and the story stunk. Chris Pratt and Elizabeth Banks were okay and Will Arnett was great as Batman. This is one of the movies where if you watched the previews you saw all the good parts. Not sure who Tiffany Haddish is but she was awful. Her character did a musical number after it was done the full movie theater was silent- no laughing no clapping no dancing. Grating voice. Just boring. Hopefully Batman 2 will save the Lego franchise."
"Really bad. This movie isn't geared towards anyone. A lot of the references are likely only understood by adults. The messaging is too on the nose. The plot is a mess. I wanted to leave after 20 minutes. The only funny part is when Maya Rudolph steps on a Lego."
"The Lego Movie 2" is a little predictable for those who are familiar with how its predecessor is plotted but it is still a humourous energetic and visually impressive film that stills provides important insight and clever referential jokes."
"Its plot was a mess bad just bad"
"Wow. Where do I begin on how much I hated this movie? Long way too long cheesy and just downright stupid. In an age where there are some great movies aimed at adults and kids this movie stinks. I was bored for 2 hours and thought it was beyond stupid. I laughed maybe twice. Didn't have the originality or sweetness of the original. Even my kids didn't like it."
"Movie is about as mediocre as you get. It's not like they had a good script and continued the franchise it was more like we can make a lot of money what can we possibly sling out there and cash in? completely forgettable story and forced references. Forgettable sequel and it's a shame."
"This movie was awesome! Nothing can compare to the first one but I think that is a fundamental law of sequels (with few exceptions) however this movie aged appropriately well with the original audience while still engaging in the next generation. The absolute best part was the fact that it kept the child engaged while also sneaking in a laugh a minute for the adults. Having a new baby girl in the house hold the moral of the story hit deep. This is certainly one I would like to add to the home collection."
"It was more of the same would of have liked a better story with less pandering. The animation is great its hilarious and great fun characters and there is a great message. 7/10 1st one is better"
"What a snore! While we were two adults bored to tears there wasn't a peep out of anyone in our audience including the kids during the movie. It was also totally silent as we were leaving. That's very unusual. As I was telling my 82 year old dad as we were leaving I can't see any kid interested after 5 minutes of watching the characters bounce around. The plot wasn't interesting the music wasn't catchy nothing."
"Funny touching pretty close to the original in terms of quality. Movie was a *hair* too long but it knocked a tear out of me and I laughed throughout."
"Just as much fun heartfelt and funny as the original with plenty of meta jokes and catchy musical numbers that made the original good. The plot twist near the end didn't really make sense but it doesn't take you out of the movie."
"Bording to long and lost the charm the original had."
"Not bad but plot arc isn� 1/2(TM)t as engaging as previous and seems a bit forced."
"Not sure how this movie is getting more than one star. Very boring and about 20 minutes too long. My kids were ready to leave after half an hour."
"I found The Second Part thoroughly entertaining from start to finish. It *almost* matches the quality of The Lego Movie but it starts off a little bumpy before it hits its stride. Regardless I highly recommend this movie to viewers of all ages!"
"Really disappointing- everything that felt fresh and fun in the first movie is missing in this one. The jokes were tired and used the characters were present in the storyline but added nothing to it and the music fell flat. Neither my son nor my husband and I would recommend it."
"Saw this today and it was awesome! I see where "Into the Spiderverse got its quirky sense of humor. While some things were a tad obvious as a whole I thought that the jokes were awesome and the message touching!"
"this isn't the sequel you are looking for if you enjoyed the first LEGO movie and the Batman LEGO movie. this is a children's musical. lost are the corny one-liners and while some of the pop culture references remain it was well disappointing."
"The LEGO movie 2 was a great experience"
"Waste of time really."
"Cute movie a lot of adult references"
"A solid film that is good yet not as good as the original. Probably the third best in the Lego franchise. Which isn`t a bad thing. All of the other movies do good. This movie looks really good. The Lego style again succeeds. A great family film for the whole gang."
"Nothing close to the first one. I was hoping it would it to finish so that I could leave."
"In my opinion this movie was better than wreck-it-ralph 2"
"This was a very interesting movie. It had a lot of ups and downs along the way but more importantly Warner Brothers and Lego really trolled the audience with their song "Catchy Song" with the only lyrics being "This song is gonna' get stuck inside your head" This song really sticks and is more annoying than the original Everything is Awesome. That leads to their new song "Everything's NOT Awesome" which is less annoying and sufficiently overshadowed. This song however actually delivers a great message about how when times seem grim you can still remain positive and prevail through tough times. Then there is the amazing and hilarious song at the end of the film made by The Lonely Island about how end credits are fun and important. The Lonely Island plays that song with sheer musical perfection and also the credits are an animation masterpiece. These songs were easily one of the best parts of this film. But there are other good aspects. One of the things that made this film stand out was acting. Chris Pratt delights as always as the good-hearted and immature Emmett. In addition he also performs well as Rex Dangervest the bounty-hunter space-traveling secret villain tough-guy. Stephanie Beatriz also does a very satisfactory job as General Mayhem the tough acting but kind-hearted Systar warrior who just wants to help the queen achieve inter-galactic friendship. Tiffany Haddish also is amazing as the definitely not evil Queen Whatevera Wannabe who also does great with her musical numbers. And never count out the hilarious Maya Rudolph who comes in for the last couple of minutes but each of those moments is comedic gold. (Stepping on Lego hurts!) Now the plot. For the most part it is okay. It shows the story of a childish person whose friends- all he cares about in the world- are taken away. In the beginning he has a vision a foreshadow that was very cliche. Emmett tries to save his friends who are stuck on the Systar system. The Systar System and it's queen is very cliche but at least they are aware of it. Then it is revealed that the Queen only wants to do what she wants to do for friendly reasons. She wants peace. This plot twist was slightly predictable but Wildstyle's relationship with the plans is very interesting as she changes her mind very quickly. On the other hand Emmett who doesn't realize this and is now the bad guy because he wants to stop what's happening. Then there is a very sudden plot twist again very unpredictable that leaves Rex Dangervest as the villain. This part was great on its own. Then Dangervest is revealed to be a time-traveling future Emmett. This part felt weird and very unnecessary. Then there is the Undar of the Dryar system (Name points) sub-plot which was just purely redundant. But it leads to some great moments of power and great messages like the message of confidence and friendship. When Dangervest disappears they get some great film reference points. But this movie is also very enjoyable especially for the younger audiences and is a very thrilling ride despite the story.From a critical standpoint this movie is passable to fair. But from a just watching standpoint the film is very fun and enjoyable."
"Lego movie 2 may not have had the ability to land humor the way they were able to in the first installment but it had plenty of funny moments and in the end had a nice message for the kids...which ours completely missed and we spend 30 minutes over dinner explaining to them."
"The movie that definitely gave the people what they need but will never top the beloved ness of the original."
"First of all my main problem with the film is the plot. The first movie has a clear plot and knew where it wanted to go. This film has really no idea where they wanted to go with anything in this film. This causes lots of issues in the movie because they didn� 1/2(TM)t have a straight forward plot that everybody could easily follow. I� 1/2(TM)m going to try and not spoil it but in the first movie there was a great plot twist that caught everybody off guard but this film they tried to do that and caused more issues in the plot. It made no sense and could have easily been taken out of the film and it would be a bit better. In the first film we got the great song � 1/2Everything is Awesome� 1/2�? so this film had to try and outdo that song and I will give them credit for trying. One of the songs is called � 1/2Catchy Song� 1/2�? and it� 1/2(TM)s not catchy one bit. At some points the film just comes to a halt so they can fit in a pointless song that it doesn� 1/2(TM)t need. All we needed was one good song in the film and instead we got ten annoying songs. The first movie didn� 1/2(TM)t overuse humour but this one tried to stuff it in at every point they could and it doesn� 1/2(TM)t work. They used humour that broke the fourth wall and only older audience members would get which isn� 1/2(TM)t good since this is a film that� 1/2(TM)s gear towards kids. The message in this film is a good one but it� 1/2(TM)s forced down your throat so much that you don� 1/2(TM)t really care about it. They also pretty much say it and spell it out throughout the entire movie. The pacing in this film is way to fast to help understand anything that� 1/2(TM)s happening in the film. Really the only good thing about this film is the animation. In the end I think this film could have been good if they kept the original directors on board. This film isn� 1/2(TM)t good for teens or adults and maybe kids will enjoy it but I would suggest seeing something else instead of this film. I give The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part a 5/10."
"This movie looks fun to watch."
"This is pretty damn fun from start to finish. It may not be emotionally potent or even wildly memorable but if you're just looking for a simple good time at the movies you'd be hard pressed to find much better than this right now."
"Go only if taking your kids!"
"It's mostly fun my kids loved it. Tons of movie and cultural references that went over the head of most of the audience (I mean seriously how many people who go see Lego Movie 2 at a Saturday matinee are going to get the references to Aliens?). The biggest fault is in the writing where the writers think the audience wants to see Emmett deconstructed and turned into a wimp. Which begs larger issues of teenage male adolescence etc. That part was absolutely nauseating but probably over the heads of most who enjoyed the funny parts."
"Way better that the original. And is more touching and meaningful that you think. Recommend for all ages. I hope they make a 3rd movie."
"A family movie with enough twist to entertain the adults."
"� 1/2 1/2Everything was Awful� 1/2 1/2� 1/2�?. There was none of the fun and parody that made the first movie so great. It is as if in the sequel the producers said � 1/2 1/2let� 1/2 1/2(TM)s do Cinema and have a message� 1/2 1/2� 1/2�?. Problem is the message is so heavy handed there is no fun. Within 10 minutes my Grabdson who loved the original was bored"
"Great movie! Great follow-up to the first Lego Movie good story with a lot of heart. Highly recommended!!!"
"As trailers showed almost all the best parts: LEGO movie 2 was a disappointment two boring kids fighting in real life ruining immersion crappy comedic timing and set design running out of budget half way through."
"Absolutely horrible. Even my kids ages 11 9 and 7couldn't believe how bad it was. Very little humor."
"Fun movie seems like theyre swinging for a movie tie-in album though with the number of songs - not as good as the first."
"my 4 year old daughter and I enjoyed it! It was a cute fun movie! Plus it kept her entertained throughout the movie! I thought it was just as good as the first one."
"A horrible waste of 2 hours. Nowhere near as imaginative or thrilling as the first one."
"I really liked this movie and I think sequels can be under appreciated so 5 stars"
"I wanted to die watching it. The first one was OK but this one was awful. I only went to see it because i had no plans and wanted to spend time with family. It's okay for the kids tho. But i think this one is an exetreme means of torture for adults taking their kids to the film or people like me who tagged along because they had nothing better to do."
"What movie the 80% of the people watch? It sure wasn't Lego 2. I was looking forward to this for a long time. Couldn't wait. How disappointing. This was a horrid sequel. It wasn't funny. The songs were dumb. The overall story was predictable and yet badly rendered. For the first time in forever I wanted to walk out of a theater. Lego movie 1 was incredible. It was a blast. Lego Batman was great fun. It had lots of laughs and entertainment but it wasn't as good as the first Lego movie. Lego Ninja was bad. A shell of what the first two were. This one was the worst of the bunch. It might be time to put these into storage..."
"It isn't as good as the first but did anyone expect it to be? This movie explores many darker themes and introduces a few new characters notably General Mayhem which is a fantastic addition to the LCU. All in all it is a good movie it's just not the first movie."
"I would say that this film is very good but not quite what the first film was: a staple in history. I didnt like the new song and how they completely scrapped all of the characters from the first film e.g. Vitruvius Lord Business and good/bad cop etc. . Would watch but not the first movie and a bit weird at times"
"Best Lego movie ever"
"Though it's not quite as good as the its predecessor Lego Movie 2: the Second Part is a very enjoyable film. I'd put it in a tie with Lego Batman for the second best installment in the franchise.This is a natural progression from the first one as we see LEGOs go against DUPLO and the girl audience-style LEGOs. Considering that they're the two other biggest brands of LEGOs it just makes sense. It is also an interesting viewpoint on conflicting styles on imagination based on age and gender.Though you couldn't really top the surprising twist from the first film this one does contain a couple pretty effective reveals which like the first really support the emotional beats of the film.LM2 is also a bit of a light musical. Due to the success of "Everything is Awesome" they added on the songs here and they work pretty well. The two best musical numbers hands down go to the ones sung by Tiffany Haddish's Queen Watevra Wa'Nabi. The comedian/actress is a surprisingly good singer. The songs are even catchier than the "Catchy Song" which was the movie's attempt to match "EiA." (I mean it's catchy but only short-term catchy.)The movie looks great. The new universe of the Systar System is really well designed and colorful. The scenes that take place in the "other dimenson" are really well lit and have a very 80's/90's feel to them. The constantly shape-shifting Queen Watevra Wa'Nabi is an impressive bit of animation. (Though it still doesn't match the amount of effort that went into the form-changing Greedy scene from Raggedy Ann & Andy: a Musical Adventure. Check it out it's really impressive.)As mentioned this doesn't quite match the first which in fairness is a high bar to reach considering how everything worked almost flawlessly. There are many funny jokes here but not the rapid succession that were in the first. Pacing isn't as fluid either. The likes of Benny Ultrakitty and Metalbeard are present throughout and have some nice lines but they really don't contribute much. Basically the writers were trying to include the whole cast but since they were telling a more personal story between leads Emmett and Wildfire they didn't seem to know what to do with everyone else.Nitpicks aside this is a film that I think the whole family will like."
"When it comes to films made for children you have to let certain things slide that may have you rolling your eyes or making you annoyed simply because the jokes aren�(TM)t for you. Personally I feel that�(TM)s only true for some films and The Lego Movie definitely didn�(TM)t fit that description because it was made for everyone. For that reason alone I was very excited for the sequel The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part. This sequel is surely made for a younger audience more so than its predecessor but the heart and comedy is just as present. This is one of the best direct sequels I�(TM)ve seen to a film in quite some time. These two films go hand in hand and I don�(TM)t want to see a third addition simply because these two work so well together. Picking up immediately following the events of the first Finn has to allow his sister to play with Legos in the real world. Jumping five years into the future to show what has become of that the heart of this film may even be larger than the first film as a whole. The sense of adventure and originality is only slightly lost here seeing as the charm of the first will never be fully captured again. There was something very special about that one and I believe that was lightning in a bottle. That truly is my only gripe with this movie because The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part builds off the characters from the first film and creates an equally enjoyable ride of a film. With Chris Pratt Elizabeth Banks Will Arnett and Tiffany Haddish (just to name a few) as the leading voices of your film it�(TM)s hard to go wrong in terms of how your comedy will be delivered. I found myself laughing hysterically on multiple occasions. From the clever puns to the emotional core this film brings by the third act this is a movie that had a lot of care put into it and the vocal performances only helped that. The characters in the real world were further explored making me appreciate the first film even more and the addition of Rex Dangervest to the cast of characters was easily one of the highlights of the movie. Not that I had an issue with these aspects but where I fear this film may lose some viewers is in its musical numbers. This movie has a lot more catchy songs than the first film and characters even break out into full musical numbers. If you�(TM)re not into musicals certain scenes may annoy you here. That being said the lyrics were hilarious and extremely clever which made for enjoyable sequences. This is a film that knows the audience it needs to pander to and I felt this film was striving for that a little more than the first.In the end The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part felt like an earned sequel that carefully took the best aspects of the first and built on them. While the spark and magic the first film left many viewers may not be completely present here it�(TM)s very hard to complain about this sequel. Seamlessly blending emotion comedy and the sense of adventure I had an absolute blast with this movie. The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part was worth the wait and is more than a worthy sequel."
"I was a big fan when the first LEGO movie came out. Chris Pratt is one of my favorites from Parks and Rec. This movie was just not the same. The theme of sibling rivalry and how they must come together was a bit on the nose. The comedy was not clever at all. By now the LEGOS are gods they can build anything and now move in the real world. It was fun at the end of the last one to see the kid was making up the whole thing but in this one they took it too far. I was very excited to see what President Business would be in this new apocalypse city. Though in the first 2 minutes he leave for golfing. Lucy's story is really just watching Emmet's story unfold and helping where she can. I saw the screening of this movie where they had the story of Lucy. She was named Bluerazz and sung "Everything is Awesome". That part of the movie was really bad and I'm glad they left it out. Unikitty was kind of funny in the first movie a sweet kitty that can turn very dark. Now to get more money off toys they make Unikitty darker and more angry. Batman was reduced to comic relief and the love interest of Tiffany Haddish. Before I get to the worst part for me there were some good parts. Queen Whatev-ra Wanabi was hilarious and her song was actually good unlike every other one in this movie. The bombs were funny and Maya Rudolph is always welcome. My favorite part of the movie was at the end when Maya steps on the LEGO. Rex Dangervest. When he appeared on screen we could hear Chris Pratt's obvious voice and the twist was revealed. Through out the movie he teaches Emmet to be evil and destroy things. The whole philosophy of Emmet is that he is a good nice person who can't be turned. Rex goes against everything and undoes his whole character. He becomes LEGO Jesus at the end when he can move on his own. He travels back in time and appears at the start of the movie and the kid accepts it. The kid doesn't question that a random LEGO just appeared started moving on its own and talking to Emmet. The plot holes in this movie can never be explained. This movie was not good and was a cash-grab sequel of a good movie."
"This film was ok. It was great to relive a childhood fav but the musical aspect kinda ruined it. Everything is still Awesome though."
"I really love the film but maybe because i wasn't watch the lego movie first part in the theater. Because i wasn't notice that the lego movie is come out that year plus im not that into the lego thing. But when unikitty from cartoon come out it makes me want to watch the movie so badly apperantly."
"Every bit as good as the first one!"
"I agree that this film is enjoyable especially for Lego fanatics. I 100% recommend it."
"Not nearly as fun and original as the first film... but this one still is entertaining and gives you plenty of amusing pop culture references to go with the story."
"I like the animation project it feels like stop motion."
"From star war to armargedon to Jurassic world to to Armageddon ... lego Movie 2 is reference overload . 5 years later Bricksburg was desolated ruins covered in dust and  invaded by aliens. After a round of action packed adrenaline pumping chasing  turns out The villain queen wa� 1/2 1/2(TM)nabi that napped the gangs and is enforcing holy matrimony on Batman is the olive stick sent from Finn� 1/2 1/2(TM)s little sister Bianca . Finn is all teenager but Not ready to let go of his legos and fought with Bianca until mom came to intervene(managethem). And the real villain turns out to be Emmett � 1/2 1/2~s future self. What� 1/2 1/2(TM)s more surprising the hand behind this change is the driven girlfriend Lucy who pushed Emmet to grow up  to be be tougher ( isn� 1/2 1/2(TM)t this a familiar theme of talk shows now a days ?)"
"The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part is never as sophisticated or as deep as its predecessor in terms of themes and meta-commentary but the gorgeous animation creative highlights and lightning-round gags make it a sweet thoughtful animated film for the whole family nonetheless"
"Not as strong as the original but still an enjoyable bricking time."
"Not as good as the first movie. Too cluttered and all over the place."
"Worst movie I have ever seen!!! Honestly the most terrible movie ever made. I asked my 5 years old do you like the movie ? He said no mom too much anger and fighting."
"Super fun film just like the other films!! I love them all!"
"Great movie better than the first."
"Absolutely terrible. The first movie was so great. This sequel? Complete trash."
"I liked this movie didn't love it. Fun spirited but safe structure. Some plotlines got overshadowed by others. Still props to Tiffany Haddish."
"Good not great. The tunes were good but the twists didn't seem as natural as they did in the first movie."
"Huge disappointing pile of MEH. Some really funny parts peppered among a lot of very mediocre parts. This is a classic sequel� 1/2"in that the studio execs obviously got their hands on it too much and exploited what made the first one such a nice surprise. If they were any more obvious about wanting to sell songs on itunes there would have been an ad and intermission for it in the middle of the movie.Was really looking forward to this one. Was met with diminishing returns."
"Absolutely garbage...no continuity. None of the magic of the first film at all. Don't waste money seeing this in the theater and pay as little as possible to stream or buy on DVD."
"Defiantly entertaining but not the sequel I was wantingthey set up a plot point and don't even follow through on it."
"Horrendous movie actually walked out. Dissapointing after all the other Lego movies."
"I'll put the warning up front: This movie has some cringe-worthy "hey let me introduce myself by singing a musical number while everyone rhymes along with me" moments. The movie overall wasn't bad and had a few funny gags but I would prefer the original way more than this. Did I mention that I'm not a fan of musicals? Not a fan."
"When making a second part for a great movie there is a lot of pressure for making another good part. This movie however accomplished more than I could have ever expected. The original LEGO movie was one of the most creative projects made to date while the sequel managed to hold on to this aspect. Everything felt fresh I didn� 1/2(TM)t complain once about bland the movie was. Another thing the movie accomplishes well is it� 1/2(TM)s pacing. Throughout the movie one of the first things that comes to mind is how fast pace the movie is. However this is the movie being unique and parodying how some movies work and this movie accomplishes it well. When the movie finishes you understand why the movie was paced as it was and it just ties everything together. Humor in a comedy is obviously one of the most important aspects and this movie nails it. The jokes weren� 1/2(TM)t cheap they all felt great and managed to appeal to all ages. Whether your are alone or with a family this movie is made anyone who loves a fresh creative story that is sure to brighten your day."
"This show it's going to be the #1 movie in the world."
"This film is Awesome!"
"I rather eat Legos then see this movie again"
"Great story for both kids and adults!"
"The start of the movie started out kinda bad then the middle made it better then the end was just amazing. The lesson it taught was very relatable to me I don't know about anyone else like it. This is a movie you should see!"
"Pretty much the sequel The LEGO Movie deserves. Just as fun and manic as the first - with the just the right amount of making fun of itself but also absolutely loving movie making. The song about watching credits at the end is spectacular (thanks Beck). The first one is a tad better."
"Loved it to every level! <3Very fun and chaotic xD Also the plot twist is awesome!"
"Not as � 1/2surprising� 1/2�? as the first but definitely lots of fun... PACKED with references that� 1/2(TM)ll fill even the most jaded super-nerd� 1/2(TM)s heart with � 1/2awesome� 1/2�?."
"A rare sequel which is every bit as fun colourful and inventive as the original."
"El trailer me gusto mas que la pelicula me parece que la primera fue mejor que esta pero igualmente creo que esta cumplio las expectativas y me parecio buena cargada de referencias y momentos muy graciosos y el final de la giros impresionantes que te recarga de mucha informacion y la animacion de efectos especiales impresionante un 7/10"
"Great sequel can�(TM)t wait for 3"
"4.5/5. Just a step down from the original. About as good a sequel as you could hope for."
"It felt like the creators forgot what made The LEGO Movie awesome in the first place. This one just felt ok."
"The first LEGO Movie really felt like it was made for everyone... The LEGO movie 2 oddly felt like it was made specifically for girls between the ages 4 and 14. And sure you'd say "it's a LEGO movie. it's for kids"... then why did it feel like the first one was made for everyone? Simply this movie was not made for someone who grew up with LEGO it was only made for a very small audience of today's children."
"Another movie from our friends in Hollywood where every male character is weak and incompetent (Emmet) or narcissistic vain (Batman) and the female characters are heroic and brave (Lucy) or powerful. Teach our boys to be wimpy. The girls will save you. You are only good when you are having dance parties and playing with glitter. Dads keep your boys away from this one."
"Basically it's Meh. The kids will love it but I'm disappointed very formulaic\predictable (with some small twists) and no heart. Definitely the worst of the Lego movies. Both Ninjago and The Lego Batman movie made me laugh this move only made me chuckle a few time. Although in it's defense the audience did laugh. I was debating seeing it in 3D. It's a good thing I saved my cash IMHO it is not worth the extra expense. Even better hopefully your kids can wait to see it on streaming"
"Not as great as the first one but it's definetely a fun time at the movies.8.8/10"
"This movie is so funny I laughed so much"
"So I just saw Lego Movie 2 and it was "JUST OK"! The film is just fluff which kind of sucks because the first film was so bold and creative. The film is just unnecessary; like a filler episode of an Anime. The movie has a handful of annoying musical numbers which kids from 6 on down will enjoy but everyone else will be cringing upon. The plot is just not impactful. I really think they just should have passed on making this one. Chris Miller and Phil Lord subverted our expectations with the first Lego Movie but this film just gave us fluff. This film was weak fun and cute entertainment like a Saturday morning cartoon. It's not going to be recognized as anything special and you and your kids will forget about it in the next week ."
"If I took the time to write a bad review it was pretty bad. Just a forced rehash of the original which was good"
"The Lego Movie 2 was ok. The animation was still spot-on and all the characters still had chemistry but the plot became a little worn and dull and most of the jokes didn't quite hit their targets. I think the biggest step down was the way the plot "twisted." I'm not gonna give any spoilers I'm just saying there's a plot twist in the end and there's literally no climb towards it. It just happens. Nobody could've guessed there were absolutely no clues it just happened because plot device. I think the funniest thing they did in this movie is completely contradict it's predecessor. The theme in the original was "be whatever you want to be" and the theme in the sequel is "It's ok to not be tough." See the contradiction there? It doesn't work out so well. Other than that I feel like the first 2 acts are brilliantly done and there are some small jokes to laugh at. It's not a must-see and don't expect a lot but it sure will cheer you up if you're bored."
"***� 1/2 - I remember not caring much for the first Lego Movie when the trailers came out for it wasn't until I caught it on DVD that I realized I missed a great one. That along with Lego Batman (and even the Ninjago movie) crack me up big time. This was also really good but doesn't have as many LOL moments as the first. Definitely need another Lego Batman movie because Will Arnett is amazing in that role.. probably my second favorite Batman to the legendary Kevin Conroy."
"Though the film doesn't quite live up to the original or the LEGO Batman Movie it still has enough enjoyment for everyone! Plenty of really good humor as usual in the lego movies. The main issue was that the plotting felt very forced though there is a really good story to be told. It just felt like it had to be shoved in there for there to be a movie in the first place and it also led to a few things making little to no sense. Overall the film is fun and full of heart and enjoyment. I can't wait to see what's next for this series of films. I'll give The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part...a B"
"Manages to just be able to top the first."
"Phil Lord and Chris Miller have done it again with a well crafted comedy that builds on the elements that make the first film special. All of the actors do an excellent job and Will Arnett's portrayal of Batman leaves me in tears laughing. I wish more animated movies like this continue to come out in the future."
"So in the first movie everything was awesome.  The comedy the newness the Easter eggs.... everything.  This time around everything is.... ok... fine... a'ight...  This is why this sequel gets just 3 Icees (out of 5).To me this movie forgot what made the first one so great and instead fell into the same type of trap of other kids movies... Teach a moral sell a soundtrack and just get by.  Don't get me wrong it seems that many of the kids in the theater enjoyed the film although there wasn't nearly as many laugh-out-loud moments like in the first one.  There were also references in the movie that only the adults will understand (throwbacks to previous comic movies as an example) but overall it was just ok.In the first movie the only song I remember hearing was the famous "Everything is Awesome".  In this movie there are at least 4-5 songs pushed into it.  Some are funny and some just... aren't. Heck there's even a song about the credits... during the credits!  It seemed to fall into that genre where it's just as important to sell a soundtrack as it is to make a movie.  There were several parts in the movie where I was actually bored.Finally the thing that I think I disliked most of all was that there was too much of the real world in this movie.  In the original you didn't know that there was a "real world" until the end and I get that you can't unring that bell... but in this one there is too much interjection of the real world into the movie which of course supports the moral of the movie like a sledge hammer on a thumbtack.Your kids will probably like this one well enough and that's who this is for... but don't expect the same (or even close) originality that came with the first... because it's just not there.There is the aforementioned song during the credits with new animation but not worth sticking around for.Enjoy..."
"Has good humour throughout however the plot is inconsistent and that doesn't help things. However it has amazing original music."
"Really great musical numbers on point stay for credits..."
"I REALLY ENJOY the way they embrace the end of the first Lego movie and build a story upon it also a good lesson to learn for families but they tried to make a statement about it which was meh and not a huge fan of the ending"
"Everything's still awesome!!!THE LEGO MOVIE: The 2nd Part.The first Lego movie was well awesome 'nuff said. And at 1 hour & 47 minuets this direct follow up continues that trend!The story flows at a brusque pace it's an effective continuation of the first adventure & the message at the film's heart kinda hits ya where you live.The cast was an assortment of stars some of whom I wasn't expecting & they all did better than in the first film!The effects were a superior blend of CGI live action & even practical Lego effects! And it all came together to make me take a closer look at MY Legos 'cause I'm no longer sure they're just plastic.The music was pop drivel but that was the joke! And I got the punch line right away!The Lego Movie: The Second Part revels in it's self awareness in the best way. It's humor is both juvenile & adult but not in a bad way. It laughs in the face of pop culture & I can't help but laugh along with it! It really IS better than the original! 5 stars outta 5! If you are a kid or were ever a kid this film has something for you!Also it's a musical that pokes fun at musicals which is AWESOME!!!!!!"
"Was not nearly as charming as the first plus they decided to indoctrinate kids with liberal anti-masculinity. The inclusion of Ruth Bader Ginsburg just goes to show their liberal bias. They would never put in Clarence Thomas for instance. They ruin movies and shows by trying to force feed us their liberal agenda. They get two stars because they at least made me chuckle a few times."
"I laughed at a celebrity cameo but not too often throughout. There is a positive message that isn't too saccharine."
"Solid sequel. Lots of new great songs and laugh out loud lines. Worth seeing with kids just like the original."
"Cuteness overload. I would put this movie in the OK category. Glad i saw it. Probably wont watch it again. Liked the overall message."
"I knew I was in for a good time little did I know it would be even better than the first. The Lego Movie 2 has more heart more humor and a FANTASTIC soundtrack! Aside from the occasional tangent this film gets more engrossing as it goes. The portrayal of youthful imagination and the changes that come with age were spot on. It's certain to strike a cord with kids and kids at heart."
"The Lego movie 2 is the fourth official Lego movie and the sequel to the Lego movie. Good animation sadly its got a lot more CGI then the original. Really good comedy I laughed out load frequently throughout the whole film especially the second act. Very good comedic timing. Very good characters even the new ones I especially liked the queen. Really good voice acting from the main cast and secondary cast. Great ideas with the jokes and characters. I really loved the songs especially Catchy song. Good cinematography. Good story thats changes frequently but in a good way. Over all I give it a 7/10"
"One of the best animated movies i have seen in a long time it was a Real BLOCK-Buster :D"
"Compared to the first Lego Movie this is absolutely terrible. Everything truly isn� 1/2 1/2(TM)t awesome. Some funny parts but nothing laugh out loud like in the first movie."
"I was at the pre-release screening of this film and I will tell you that the second part is better than the first one."
"Not as good as the first one but it's still a good movie"
"While it continues the rapid-fire gag rate of the original with tons of cuteness for kids some gut-busting pop-culture references for adults and a final act with some surprising twists; its own merits on the whole don't add up as high as before."
"Very clever comedy but the ending plays it too safe. Creating a messy montage of how we all expect this movie to end."
"Was a big fan of the original but can't help but feel this sequel is lacking. It isn't bad it's just not great. It is still loaded with an abundance of self-aware humor pop culture and geek culture references but it doesn't quite click like the original. It definitely left me a little underwhelmed."
"The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part proves that everything is still awesome."
"The Lego Movie 2 surprisingly lives up to it's predecessor with a clever plot great message fun adventure excellent voice work and ace humour. Everything is still awesome!"
"All the humor and talent from the original plus a few new stand out performances. It may not have as much heart but makes it up in memorable songs and the many meta jokes. Highly recommend to those who enjoyed the original."
"Is everything I was waiting to see in the sequel and more. Great plot twists characters animation jokes and heartwarming moments. Is an improvement over the last 2 LEGO movies we got and I can't wait to see it again"
"Pretty cool! Once again very funny and silly and I cried even"
"great move but not as good as the original"
"The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part is AWESOME! Like the other LEGO movies the animation is beautiful. Also Batman has some of the best scenes the new worlds like the Systar System are very cool most of the jokes are hilarious (even the references) and like the original has lots of heart and a great message. This is a must see in theaters. It is something that the whole family will enjoy."
"I had such a fun time with this film; from start to finish I never stopped laughing. Not as magical or quite as good as the first but still a fun time to be had with a ton of meta humor. The story here is well done with messages discussing kindness and growing up while either changing or staying true to yourself. I�(TM)m not the biggest fan of Chris Pratt but this just may be my favorite role of his. His comedic timing as Emmet as well as new character Rex Dangervest is topnotch. Elizabeth Banks as Lucy/Wyldstyle and Will Arnett as Batman both return hilarious as ever with an absolutely amazing scene with a new character voiced by Tiffany Haddish. There are so many great cameos here that will leave you holding your gut laughing along with plenty of jokes just for the adults in the room I really appreciated every single one of them. Definitely check this one out with the family."
"Very good movie. People who say it's political clearly didn't see the movie."
"While it doesn't have the light-hearted magic of the first movie the Lego movie 2 is a stunning spectacle with plenty of fun humor and emotional depth to spare."
"Everything is awesome!"
"SPOILER REVIEWWhat you read about this movie not being as great as the first one is sorta true. Most of the movie is making fun of Everything is Awesome song. If you have seen the trailer you basically seen 80% of Act One. Act one will still have you laughing and chuckling. Emmet and the gang have that same awesome (heheh) charm. DONT LISTEN TO THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS THIS MOVIE IS GREAT. If you are looking to laugh for 90 mintues (like I was) then this is your movie. There is the terrible animated pattern of twist villains and this movie falls for that. Rex ends up being the twist villain it kinda makes sense but this pattern (most recently Incredibles 2) is getting old. Otherwise this movie is perfect. GO SEE IT!"
"First movie was good. This was a disaster. Worst movie ever!crap"
"Another franchise has fallen victim to SJWs and NPCs. This movie lacks the clever humor from the original and changes the once lovable characters into machines to spread anti-male propaganda. This is incredibly painful in the third act when Rex turns out to be a twist villain. (a cliche I'm sick of) The movie also changed Batman into an effeminate shell of his former self. It also switches to live action sequences too often when the story if you can call it that should be told through animation. Don't let this harmful message be spread to your kids stay home from this movie."
"fun enjoyable yet dosent compare to the Lego Movie or the Lego Batman Movie."
"THE LEGO MOVIE 2 THE SECOND PART IT'S AMAZING I'LL GIVE THE LEGO MOVIE 2 THE SECOND PART TWO THUMBS UP WAY UP AND I'LL GIVE THE LEGO MOVIE 2 THE SECOND PART THEIR FULL BUDGET"
"its the best movie i have seen the best part is at the end were these a big twist sorry but i can't give it away you should go see it when it comes out on February 8 its the best"
"fun and enjoyable easily the second best lego film"
"For sequel that's nice and here you can find a really big ocean of Easter eggs like Mad Max or smth with Bruce Willis but prequel seems more coherent with more original style and script."
"I wouldn't let my three children near this movie. It's not going to happen. With all due respect I won't let politics nor politically informed values near my kids."
"This just reminds me that cinema is dead."
"It is an excellent movie to see whether or not you have a kid; there is good humor fantastic animation and a well-paced story. What makes this film unique is that it has a perfect mixture of animation AND live action. A smart thing that this movie did is have the choices of the live action kids directly impact the things that happen in the lego world."
"I cant wait to see it and it looks fun in a good way and i loved the 1st one of the lego movie and i know i am going to loved it and me and my friend are going to watch February 9 and i would watch it on the February 8 but i am busy that day : ( and i still cant wait to see it"
"Everything is awesome"
"Jedva � 1/2�?ekam - nastavak najboljeg crtanog filma unazad 20 godina (bar)"
"It good and funny and it is also good to watch for all ages."
"Lego movie 2 is the greatest movie ever made!!!!!! go and see it in theaters in February 8."
"Leftist propaganda attempting to make the prejudiced ginsberg a respectable character? That is an easy pass for me and most of America. Another disaster for out of touch hollyweird"
"I don't know what everyone is talking about. It's waaaay better than the first movie!"
"The LEGO Movie 2 is a great sequel to a great movie the animation was just as spot on as the first the jokes were a little to half baked for my taste but still this is a great film for the family."
"This was great Awesome movie �~?"
"I think it will take a new approach and rely on the comedy aspect of the film and the lego sets."
"I can't believe they waited it's been 5 years since the predecessor. I'm hoping it's worth the wait."
"Saw it during the preview week. I enjoyed it just as much as the original. The story was original and had some twists that I did see coming and some that I honestly didn't. I can't wait to see it again and for it to come out officially so that I can actually discuss it with friends and family."
"Do not be fooled by the positive early word for this movie! The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part feels like like they had a minimal story idea and at a certain point had nowhere to go. My problem with the first movie is the same problem here. We have no place to go with the story so lets go to the "human" universe to end and fix the movie and wrap it up that way since we had no ending... At least the message in the first was good- we are all kids at heart. Which is true it's always there inside all of us... Here the message is brothers and sisters fight but can still love each other? I guess that is part of the message? We are always family? It's not clear. Sidenote: I am concerned with this family because it seems they use Legos as a therapy trope and to end conflics. Maybe in part three someone calls the authorities on them and the Legos are attacked by Magna-tiles? Outside of its problems some the jokes do hit and I really like the soundtrack. Which is funnier than the movie itself and I liked the end credits which are both a mess and clever. Two stars out of four. Now for the non-discriminate kids it's all colors noise music. My three year old liked it but kept asking if it was over let... Not as good as the first one which I liked a lot. This is a cash grab."
"Saw the first when I was really little can't wait to see how this one turned out!"
"Lego Movie 2: The Second part was as great as it was the animation was top notch with the use of lego creativity like the previous and its relevant to something kids will love especially if they love legos quite enyoyable from start to finish however it has less to offer and isnt as inspiring as the first which lacks some of that magic but its as entertaining as it is. A great message is also present at the end and I thought it was a charming and sweet message about growing up and leaving everything behind type of stuff I liked it. Overall 8/10 I thought Lego movie 2 will entertain audiences with little to worry and I liked it yet as a sequel it didnt offer much but its as enjoyable and has good jokes and references to laugh at. Would recomend"
"Saw an early screening of this and it wasn�(TM)t for me. Based off the reaction around me however the families in attendance seemed to really enjoy it."
"This is Film so good i Think!!!"
"The Lego movie part 2 is awesome"
"The Lego Movie 2 is an amazing animated comedy that� 1/2(TM)s both great for kids and adults. There� 1/2(TM)s some good pop culture references that adults (and cool grown up kids) will understand. The voice acting and animation holds up pretty good. Some of the songs are good but will definitely get stuck in your head. There� 1/2(TM)s a plot twist that most people won� 1/2(TM)t see coming. The lesson of the movie is also very good. You should definitely see this movie in theaters if you want to have a good time."
"It�(TM)s very dull movie make you sleepyVery bad beginning first LEGO movie was muchBetter. Very boring! Plot is stupidRating 1 Star"

"This movie won't let anyone down. It's trailer is very promising."
"My children love legos. Using boxxy software with VPN make watching perfectly safe and private﻿"
"Even as the saying goes "Sequels are always worse" im sure this wont apply to the sequel."
"I loved the first Lego movie so I'm looking forward for this movie"
"Why don't ruin the first one"
"First one was amazing but not really meant to have a sequel made off of it. Let's all hope this is more Toy Story 2 than Cars 2. :P"
